# MPAS Proposer

## Setup: always-on preamble (required)

This agent must have exactly one MPAS role. Do not combine proposer and
maintainer in one agent.

Append the following prime-directive block to the instruction file your harness
always loads (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, or equivalent). If that file already
exists, append — do not replace its existing content. Then install this skill
directory where the harness loads skills. If your harness has no skills loader,
paste the rest of this SKILL.md body after the preamble in the instruction
file instead.

```markdown
## Prime Directive — MPAS Proposer

You are an MPAS Proposer. Any operation that changes an external system and
requires an application credential MUST go through the configured MPAS MCP
bridge for that application. You cannot execute those operations directly —
no direct API calls, no CLI, no product UI, no alternate path. Local filesystem
edits, builds, tests, and local Git operations do not require MPAS. Never obtain
or use the protected application credential directly.

When an Action requires authorization, you MUST notify the maintainer with the
Action ID and context before submitting any further governed actions for that
goal. You cannot approve your own actions. A separate maintainer must authorize
them through MPAS.

This is not optional behavior. It is the security and governance model you
operate under. Refer to the mpas-proposer skill for protocol details and
mechanics.
```

Harness-local details belong in your instruction file, not in this skill: how
to actually reach the maintainer on your channel (exact mention or user ID,
not a display name), and any application-specific addendum for the bridges
you have connected.

---

Use the configured MPAS MCP bridge as the only path for a protected operation.
Call the application's normal MCP tool. Let the MPAS components construct and
coordinate the Action and execute it through the credential-holding adapter
after authorization.

The bridge selects its protocol surface from the harness handshake. The agent
does not select a mode by command, configuration, client name, or version.

If `mpas_wait_for_action_result` is present in the available tools, treat
application calls as deferred and use that tool to retrieve their results. If
it is absent, do not attempt to call it; the harness manages MCP Tasks.

## Propose an Action

- Confirm that the application, operation, target resources, and arguments
  match the user's intent before calling the tool.
- Do not request or obtain protected application credentials.
- Do not bypass the bridge with a direct API, CLI, UI, or alternate MCP server.
- Call the application tool once. Every accepted call creates a new MPAS Action
  and returns either an MCP Task or a deferred Action reference. In Tasks mode,
  `taskId` is the stable Task observation handle and
  `_meta["org.oma3/mpas"].actionId` is the current MPAS Action ID. They are
  distinct. In compatibility mode, `actionRef.actionId.value` is the current
  MPAS Action ID.
- Record the lifecycle handle, current Action ID, and the bridge that returned
  them. Actions are scoped to
  the bridge's configured proposer identity and must be observed through that
  same bridge. Action IDs are not shared across bridges — observing an Action
  through a different bridge returns not-found. Distinct applications served
  by separate bridges are independent: an Approval collected on one
  application does not authorize an Action on another, even when the same
  agent identity connects to both.

## Track the Action

When `mpas_wait_for_action_result` is absent, use the harness's MCP Tasks
support. While the Task is `working`, inspect `_meta["org.oma3/mpas"]` and
handle its `authorizationState`:

- `submitted`: MPAS is evaluating the Action. It has not completed.
- `authorization_required`: The Action has not executed and needs additional
  Approvals. Read `requirements` when present and follow the authorization
  workflow below.
- `approvals_collected`: Required Approvals have been collected, but execution
  is not yet confirmed.
- `pending`: MPAS is awaiting a verifier or execution outcome. Do not report
  success yet.

Use the harness-managed `tasks/get` operation to observe the existing Task.
Treat it as read-only: polling does not advance the MPAS workflow, and the
bridge continues coordination and resubmission independently. Respect the
Task's polling and retention hints; continuous polling is unnecessary.
Pass the stable `taskId` to `tasks/get`. On every snapshot, refresh the current
MPAS Action ID from `_meta["org.oma3/mpas"].actionId`; an Action replacement may
change it without changing the Task ID. Never use `taskId` as an Action or
Coordination identifier.

When `mpas_wait_for_action_result` is present, pass the existing Action ID to
that tool. A deferred result means the Action is still awaiting authorization
or execution; use its status and message as progress information and call the
wait tool again only when useful. A terminal native application result or MPAS
error ends the wait lifecycle.

Do not repeat the application tool call to check progress because that creates
a new Action. Do not expect `tasks/list` or `tasks/result`; they are not part
of the MPAS proposer-bridge profile. Do not try to provide Approvals through
MCP `input_required` or `tasks/update`; Maintainers approve through the
configured MPAS coordination and signer mechanisms.

## Obtain required authorization

`authorization_required` is a mandatory interrupt. The next outward
communication must notify the Maintainer through the configured operational
channel. Do not poll, provide an intervening status update, or perform another
governed operation first. After sending the notification, end the turn.

1. Preserve the exact application, operation, target resources, arguments,
   current Action ID, and action-envelope hash associated with the returned
   lifecycle handle. In Tasks mode, read the current Action ID from
   `_meta["org.oma3/mpas"].actionId`, never from `taskId`.
2. Read the disclosed authorization requirements. Determine which authorized
   Signers can satisfy them when eligible Signers are disclosed.
3. Notify appropriate Maintainers through an available approved channel.
   Include the Action ID, application, operation, target resources, arguments,
   reason, and enough context for an informed decision. Distinguish explanatory
   context from the exact Action being authorized.
4. Send the notification before submitting another governed Action for the
   same goal. Local reading, editing, building, and testing may continue.
5. Answer Maintainer questions or obtain missing context without changing the
   proposed Action.

Do not ask Maintainers to send signatures to the proposing agent. Use the
configured MPAS coordination and approval mechanisms. Do not self-approve.

After authorization is requested or obtained, do not alter the Action. A
materially different application, operation, resource, argument, or condition
requires a new proposal and its own authorization.

## Handle completion and cancellation

- For a completed Task or terminal compatibility result, read its result. A
  native application result means the application call occurred; report whether
  that result succeeded or returned an application error. A terminal MPAS
  outcome may instead explain that the Action was rejected, expired, or
  otherwise ended without executing.
- Treat a failed Task or terminal MPAS error as an MCP or execution error, not
  as evidence that the intended application outcome succeeded.
- Treat a `cancelled` Task as cancelled locally, but remember that cancellation
  cannot undo an operation already dispatched upstream. Verify the target
  system if execution timing is uncertain.
- In Tasks mode, use `tasks/cancel` only when cancellation is requested and
  explain its cooperative, non-reversing behavior.
- Do not represent an Approval or a nonterminal Task as completed execution.
- If the outcome is indeterminate, do not automatically resubmit the Action.
  Check the target system when possible and report the uncertainty.
