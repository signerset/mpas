Canonical repository for the MPAS (Multi-Party Action Security) standard and reference implementation.

MPAS is a protocol for multi-party approval of high-impact digital actions.
In this document, **Agent** means any entity that can hold a private key and
participate as a Proposer or Signer — a human, AI agent, device, service, or
organization — not only an LLM-driven process.

Instead of giving agents direct access to privileged APIs, MPAS routes actions
through a Credential Adapter that enforces policy-based approval workflows
before execution. No single agent can both propose and approve the same action.

MCP is one execution profile and the path used by the bridge generator and
demo in this repository. The protocol itself is not limited to MCP; other
execution profiles can carry MPAS Action Packages for non-MCP environments.

### How It Works

1. An agent calls an MCP tool (e.g., `delete_branch`)
2. The MCP Bridge constructs and signs an Action Package, submits it to the Credential Adapter
3. The Credential Adapter verifies the signature and evaluates policy:
   - If auto-approved: dispatches immediately to the target and returns the result
   - If approval required: returns `additionalApprovalsRequired`
4. The bridge submits the pending action to the Coordination Service and polls for resolution
5. A maintainer agent approves (or rejects) the action
6. The bridge resubmits the completed Action Package to the adapter
7. The adapter verifies full policy satisfaction, dispatches, and returns an Execution Receipt

### Key Security Properties

- Agents hold no privileged credentials — all writes route through the adapter
- The adapter verifies cryptographic signatures and evaluates policy before dispatching
- Self-approval is prevented at both coordination and policy engine levels
- The Coordination Service is optional infrastructure, not a protocol requirement

### The Governance Boundary

The Application Plugin plus the deployment policy define the **governed set** of operations. An operation in that set gets schema validation and policy evaluation (thresholds, signer groups, `defaultRequirement`). An operation outside that set is routed as **pass-through**: after proposer gating and signature verification it executes with the adapter's credential on the proposer's signature alone — `defaultRequirement` does not apply to it. This reflects the plugin-anchored trust model: the plugin publisher — typically the party that knows the target API best, attested via OMATrust, decides which operations need governance. Operators ratify that decision by trusting the publisher. If you care about an operation, put it in the policy entry; power users who want unlisted operations refused entirely can set `passThrough: "deny"` in the deployment config.

## What This Repository Contains

This repository is the OMA3-owned home of the MPAS standard:

- **Specifications** — the MPAS protocol documents (core, profiles, schemas)
- **SDK** — `@oma3/mpas` protocol library (types, verification, policy engine, receipts, proposer primitives, protocol clients)
- **Bridge generator** — development-time tool that generates a static MCP bridge (and plugin scaffold) from a running MCP server
- **Reference implementation** — a runnable implementation of the full MPAS flow (propose → review/approve → dispatch), including operator services, signer tooling, and a human Maintainer CLI
- **Application registry** — per-application descriptors referencing known implementations
- **Conformance model** — the conformance roles and test model (official test tools planned; see `conformance/`)
- **Documentation** — developer guides, architecture docs, and website content
- **Agent skills** — reusable proposer and maintainer skill packages (`integrations/skills/`)

## What This Repository Does Not Contain

- A vendor-supported production distribution or hosted operations bundle
- Production bridges or plugins
- A guarantee that the reference implementation is production-hardened or
  independently audited

The reference credential adapter uses a JSON policy format as a pragmatic,
fully runnable implementation choice. Production implementations may use OPA,
Cedar, or any other policy engine that satisfies the MPAS specification
requirements.

Production implementations are maintained independently — reference implementations live in `oma3/mpas-applications`, and third-party or vendor implementations live in their publishers' repositories. The application registry in this repo is the index that points to all of them. This split is deliberate: this repository is the normative home (specifications, SDK, conformance, registry, teaching examples); implementations people deploy in production live elsewhere.

## Build and Verify

MPAS requires Node.js 22 or later. From the repository root, install the locked
dependencies, build each package, and run the test suites in dependency order:

```sh
npm ci --prefix sdk/protocol
npm run build --prefix sdk/protocol
npm test --prefix sdk/protocol

npm ci --prefix bridge-generator
npm run build --prefix bridge-generator
npm test --prefix bridge-generator

npm ci --prefix examples/demo
npm run build --prefix examples/demo
npm test --prefix examples/demo
npm run test:e2e:mcp-bridge --prefix examples/demo
```

For the complete local governed-action walkthrough, including proposer,
maintainer, Credential Adapter, policy, and agent-harness configuration, follow
the [macOS demo setup guide](examples/demo/guides/setup-macos.md).
