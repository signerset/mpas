# MPAS HTTP Profile

**Status:** Draft v0.2
**Companion to:** MPAS Core Specification  
**Scope:** HTTP transport profile for MPAS Action Package submission, Action Relay delivery, Signer approval requests, Coordination Service workflows, polling, and receipt distribution.
**Normative keywords:** The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

---

## 1. Introduction

The core MPAS specification defines transport-neutral artifacts and processing rules for multi-party authorization of digital Actions. Those artifacts include:

- Execution Payload
- Action Envelope
- Signer Review Set
- Approval
- Approval Bundle
- Action Package
- Authorization Requirements
- Execution Receipt

This profile defines how MPAS participants exchange those artifacts over HTTP.

The primary operation in this profile is not a request for abstract verification. The primary operation is a request to process an Action Package and execute the Action if policy is satisfied. Verification is the deterministic processing step performed by the Verifier before execution.

This profile defines four HTTP interfaces:

1. **Verifier / Application Action Interface**  
   Used by a Proposer to submit an Action Package to the logical Verifier using `POST /mpas/v1/verifier/action`, either directly or through an Action Relay.

2. **Signer Approval Interface**  
   Used by a Proposer or Coordination Service to request a Signer decision using `POST /mpas/v1/approval-request`.

3. **Action Relay Interface**
   Used to route addressed Delivery Envelopes between a Proposer and a Verifier that cannot accept an inbound connection.

4. **Coordination Service Interface**
   Used by Proposers and Signers to create and observe approval workflows, submit Approvals, cancel pending actions, and retrieve completed Action Packages.

The Action Relay and Coordination Service are independently optional. Direct Proposer-to-Verifier and Proposer-to-Signer flows remain valid.

---

## 2. Scope and Non-Goals

### 2.1 Scope

This profile specifies:

- HTTP content type and message conventions.
- Standard HTTP status code usage.
- Standard error envelope.
- Action request and response wire format.
- Signer approval request and response wire format.
- Minimal Action Relay and Coordination Service HTTP interfaces.
- Polling-first relay and coordination behavior.
- Optional service discovery.
- Action Relay and Coordination Service trust boundaries.
- Coordination Service conflict rules for `actionId` and `actionEnvelopeHash`.
- Execution Receipt return and distribution behavior.

### 2.2 Non-Goals

This profile does not define:

- A universal policy language.
- A Credential Adapter plugin system.
- Hosted platform administration APIs.
- Billing, tenant, notification-vendor, or dashboard-specific APIs.
- Application-specific Execution Payload schemas.
- Human-readable rendering descriptors.
- DID authentication, OAuth, passkey, SSO, mTLS, or enterprise identity protocols other than the RFC 9421 profile defined in §4.6.
- Smart contract interfaces.
- MPC/TSS signing protocols.

Authentication is defined in §4.6. Tenancy, rate limiting, and service operator policy beyond authentication are deployment-specific. HTTP authentication is not an MPAS Approval.

---

## 3. Relationship to Core MPAS

This document profiles the transport behavior for the core MPAS protocol. It does not replace the core MPAS specification.

The core MPAS specification remains authoritative for:

- object definitions;
- canonicalization;
- hash computation;
- Approval validity;
- Approval Bundle validity;
- Signer review obligations;
- Verifier processing obligations;
- Execution Receipt semantics;
- separation between coordination and authorization.

This HTTP profile adds a concrete API contract so independently implemented Proposers, Signers, Action Relays, Coordination Services, Verifiers, and Applications can interoperate.

---

## 4. Common HTTP Rules

### 4.1 TLS

HTTP endpoints implementing this profile **MUST** use HTTPS in production deployments.

Plain HTTP **MAY** be used only in non-production deployments where transport risk is addressed. This allowance never relaxes the authentication enforcement requirements in §4.6.5.

### 4.2 Content Type

Requests and responses carrying MPAS profile messages **MUST** use:

```http
Content-Type: application/mpas+json
Accept: application/mpas+json
```

Implementations **MAY** accept `application/json` for compatibility, but conforming clients **SHOULD** use `application/mpas+json`.

### 4.3 POST-Based Protocol Operations

All MPAS protocol operations in this profile use `POST`.

This profile intentionally avoids using `GET` for protocol operations because MPAS messages often contain scoped identifiers, hashes, sensitive metadata, cursors, and participant filters that are safer and simpler to represent in JSON request bodies.

`GET` **MAY** be used for optional service discovery, health checks, or static metadata.

### 4.4 Authentication Is Not Approval

HTTP authentication identifies the caller to the service. It is not an MPAS Approval.

MPAS participant authentication **MUST** use the RFC 9421 profile defined in §4.6. Deployments **MAY** additionally impose transport or infrastructure controls (mTLS, enterprise SSO, gateway authentication, network allowlists); these are not a substitute for the §4.6 profile and **MUST NOT** be used to derive participant identity.

A Verifier **MUST NOT** treat HTTP authentication, relay or coordination routing, notification delivery, or transport metadata as an Approval unless the Verifier's policy explicitly recognizes a corresponding MPAS Approval or trusted external approval record.

### 4.5 Idempotency

Unsafe requests that create or mutate protocol state **SHOULD** include an `idempotencyKey` field in the request message. The field is an opaque client-generated string of at most 128 characters. A UUID is RECOMMENDED.

For objects that have a routing wrapper around the request (for example, `DeliveryEnvelope<ActionRequest>`), the key remains inside the enclosed request; the wrapper has no idempotency field. The Action-processing layer, not the routing layer, resolves the key.

Request equivalence is layered: every object carrying `idempotencyKey`, and every routing frame around it, defines the significant fields for its own layer. Version 1 defines:

- `DeliveryEnvelope`: `sender`, `recipients` compared as a set, and the enclosed payload's equivalence contribution are significant; `createdAt`, `expiresAt`, and `audience` are not. The first accepted envelope remains authoritative, so a retry does not extend its stored expiry.
- `ActionRequest`, `CoordinationActionRequest`, `CoordinationApprovalSubmission`, and `CoordinationActionCancelRequest`: every field except `idempotencyKey` and `audience` is significant.

An object with no defined equivalence scope **MUST NOT** carry a body-level idempotency key. Implementations **MUST** fail closed for an unknown scope rather than silently use a whole-body fingerprint.

Idempotency keys are especially important for:

- submitting an Action Package to a logical Verifier endpoint, including an Action Relay;
- submitting an Approval to a Coordination Service;
- retrying submission of a completed, coordinated Action Package after network failure.

The A1 policy-evaluation submission and the later completed A2 submission are different Actions and distinct mutations. They therefore have different Action IDs, Action Envelope hashes, Delivery Envelopes, and idempotency keys. Exact retries of either mutation reuse that mutation's Action ID and idempotency key.

If the same idempotency key is reused with a non-equivalent request, the server **SHOULD** return `409 Conflict`.

`idempotencyKey` and RFC 9421 signature `nonce` (§4.6) are orthogonal. A retry carries the same idempotency key (to get the stored result) and a fresh nonce (to pass replay protection). Collapsing them would cause a legitimate retry to be rejected as a replay.

A server **SHOULD** accept the HTTP header `Idempotency-Key` when the request message omits `idempotencyKey`. If both are present and differ, it **MUST** return `400 idempotency_mismatch`. Header-only idempotency is compatibility behavior.

### 4.6 Authentication Profile (RFC 9421)

Authentication enforcement is determined solely by the trust boundary and endpoint role (§4.6.5).

Authentication uses [RFC 9421 HTTP Message Signatures](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9421) with [RFC 9530 Content-Digest](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9530). The caller proves control of the DID it claims by signing the request with the corresponding Ed25519 or P-256 key.

#### 4.6.1 Wire Format

```http
POST /mpas/v1/coordination/poll HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/mpas+json
Content-Digest: sha-256=:X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=:
Signature-Input: mpas=("@method" "@path" "content-digest");\
  created=1754400000;expires=1754400060;\
  keyid="did:jwk:eyJjcnYiOiJFZDI1NTE5Iiwia3R5IjoiT0tQIiwieCI6Ii4uLiJ9";\
  nonce="f9a3c1b7e2d4508a";tag="mpas-v1";alg="ed25519"
Signature: mpas=:K2qGT5srn2OGbOIDzQ6kYT+ruaycnDAAUpKv+ePFfD0RAxn...:

{"version":"1","type":"CoordinationPollRequest",
 "did":"did:jwk:eyJjcnYiOiJFZDI1NTE5Iiwia3R5IjoiT0tQIiwieCI6Ii4uLiJ9",
 "audience":"https://coordination.example.com"}
```

Signature base:

```
"@method": POST
"@path": /mpas/v1/coordination/poll
"content-digest": sha-256=:X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=:
"@signature-params": ("@method" "@path" "content-digest");created=1754400000;\
expires=1754400060;keyid="did:jwk:...";nonce="f9a3c1b7e2d4508a";tag="mpas-v1";alg="ed25519"
```

#### 4.6.2 Signature Requirements

Covered components **MUST** be exactly `("@method" "@path" "content-digest")`. `@authority` and `@target-uri` **MUST NOT** be covered — TLS-terminating reverse proxies may rewrite `Host`, making verification brittle.

`keyid` **MUST** be the caller's DID. The DID **MUST** use the `did:jwk` method. The verification key **MUST** be derived from `keyid` by decoding the embedded JWK. The embedded JWK **MUST** contain public key material only; a verifier **MUST** reject any `did:jwk` containing private key material. No DID document is fetched; no resolver is invoked.

The key MUST satisfy the Core specification's public-key suite rules. Conforming verifiers MUST verify both suites and MUST NOT be configurable to disable either:

| Public JWK | RFC 9421 `alg` | Signature bytes |
|---|---|---|
| OKP/Ed25519 | `ed25519` | 64-byte Ed25519 signature |
| EC/P-256 | `ecdsa-p256-sha256` | 64-byte raw `R || S`, each unsigned big-endian integer padded to 32 bytes |

New signing implementations MUST include the suite-derived `alg` in the signed `Signature-Input` parameters. If HTTP `alg` is absent, its claimed value for algorithm matching MUST be `ed25519`. Verifiers MUST reconstruct the signature base from the received parameters, without inserting the default into `@signature-params`. P-256 with absent `alg` MUST fail as a key/algorithm mismatch. This standing rule is HTTP-only; JWS requires protected `alg`.

The verifier MUST validate the public key and derive its suite before checking the claimed algorithm. Unknown identifiers, JWS names used as HTTP identifiers, key/algorithm mismatches, unsupported curves, incorrect lengths, invalid ECDSA scalars, and DER-encoded ECDSA wire signatures MUST be rejected. The original absent-`alg` Ed25519 fixtures remain valid, alongside separate explicit-`alg` fixtures for new senders. SHA-256 is applied exactly once to the complete P-256 signature base; callers MUST NOT pre-hash.

`created` and `expires` **MUST** be present integer timestamps. `expires` **MUST** be strictly greater than `created`, and `expires - created` **MUST NOT** exceed 60 seconds. This ceiling is the declared-lifetime MPAS profile constraint that bounds replay exposure and nonce-retention requirements. Clients and deployments **MAY** choose a shorter period but not a longer one. The server **MUST** reject requests whose `created` is in the future beyond configured `clockSkew` (suggested default: 30 seconds), or whose `expires` has passed. The declared maximum lifetime remains 60 seconds, but configured future clock skew can extend the server-observed acceptance horizon by up to `clockSkew`.

`nonce` **MUST** be present. On state-mutating endpoints, only after signature, digest, freshness, audience, identity, authorization, and side-effect-free business preflight validation succeeds and immediately before mutation, the server **MUST** atomically claim `(keyid, nonce)`. Exactly one concurrent claim **MUST** succeed. A successful claim **MUST** remain retained through `expires`; a failed claim **MUST** be rejected as replay. Invalid requests **MUST NOT** consume a nonce. An integration whose store operation combines validation and mutation **MUST** introduce a side-effect-free preflight so that the nonce claim can occur after validation and before commit. On read-only idempotent endpoints, freshness validation alone is acceptable. `/verifier/action`, `/relay/delivery`, relay and coordination session issuance, `/coordination/workflow`, `/coordination/approval`, and `/coordination/workflow-cancel` are state-mutating; relay and coordination poll are read-only. Temporary compatibility aliases have the same mutation and nonce behavior as their canonical operation.

Signers **MUST** set the `tag` signature parameter to `mpas-v1`. The `tag` identifies the MPAS application profile and, as a signature parameter, is covered by `@signature-params`. A dictionary member's label correlates its `Signature-Input` value with the member of the same label in `Signature`; the label does not authenticate identity. The label **SHOULD** be `mpas`, but an alternate label is conforming when it matches in both dictionaries.

A verifier **MUST** parse both dictionaries. Absence of both signature headers is handled as missing authentication under §4.6.6. If only one header is present, either dictionary is malformed, or the selected input lacks its same-label `Signature` member, verification **MUST** fail as `signature_invalid`. The verifier **MUST** select exactly one `Signature-Input` member tagged `mpas-v1`; unrelated members with other tags are ignored for MPAS candidate selection. Zero or multiple `mpas-v1` candidates **MUST** be rejected. For example, `Signature-Input: legacy=(...);tag="other", alt=(...);tag="mpas-v1"` is conforming when `Signature` contains an `alt` member; the alternate `alt` label carries no identity semantics.

`Content-Digest` **MUST** be present and **MUST** use the `sha-256` algorithm (RFC 9530). The server **MUST** verify the digest against the received body.

#### 4.6.3 Audience

Every request carrying an MPAS HTTP Message Signature **MUST** carry an `audience` field in its outermost body object. Other interfaces add `audience` to their request schemas when they adopt enforcement (§4.6.4.2, §4.6.4.3).

The client derives `audience` from the origin of its configured service URL: scheme + host + port when non-default, with no path or trailing slash. For example, `https://coordination.example.com/mpas/v1/coordination/` yields `https://coordination.example.com`. This derivation is the only audience configuration clients and bridges need.

An enforcing server's configured audience is a non-empty set of valid origins. The server **MUST** compare the request's `audience` against each configured value using exact string match; no normalization or subdomain matching is applied. A match against any member satisfies the check. Every configured origin **MUST** genuinely be an origin of that service.

`audience` is bound to the signature transitively through `content-digest`. It prevents a signature captured at one deployment from being replayed at another.

An unsigned request sent to a service that does not enforce authentication **MAY** omit `audience`. A server that does not enforce authentication **MUST** ignore `audience` if present. This ensures signed and unsigned clients work against unenforcing servers without special-casing.

#### 4.6.4 Identity Binding and Endpoint Authorization

Before processing a signed request under this profile, every representation of the participant identity required by that endpoint **MUST** be equal. Any mismatch **MUST** be rejected with `403 permission_denied`. Once the representations are equal, this profile does not prescribe which equal representation an implementation uses internally.

Each endpoint interface defines the required equality invariant and resulting scope.

##### 4.6.4.1 Action Relay

- `verifier/action`: signature `keyid` **MUST** equal `DeliveryEnvelope.sender` and the enclosed `ActionEnvelope.proposer.did` when an Action Relay hosts the endpoint.
- `relay/poll`: signature `keyid` **MUST** equal `RelayPollRequest.did`; the request **MUST** be scoped to that DID.
- `relay/delivery`: signature `keyid` **MUST** equal `DeliveryEnvelope.sender`, `ActionResponse.verifier.did`, and the relayed Action's recorded configured Verifier DID.
- `relay/session`: signature `keyid` **MUST** equal `RelaySessionRequest.did`.

##### 4.6.4.2 Coordination Service

- `coordination/poll`: signature `keyid` **MUST** equal `CoordinationPollRequest.did`; the request **MUST** be scoped to that agreed DID.
- `coordination/workflow-cancel`: signature `keyid` **MUST** equal request `proposerDid`, and both **MUST** equal the stored proposer.
- `coordination/workflow`: signature `keyid` **MUST** equal `actionPackage.actionEnvelope.proposer.did`.
- `coordination/session`: signature `keyid` **MUST** equal `CoordinationSessionRequest.did`.
- `coordination/approval`: signature `keyid` **MUST** equal the signer DID decoded from the Approval, and that DID **MUST** be an eligible signer for the referenced workflow.

Each equality and eligibility check occurs before processing, and any mismatch or ineligibility **MUST** be rejected with `403 permission_denied`. Version 1 retains the required `CoordinationPollRequest.did` and `CoordinationActionCancelRequest.proposerDid` fields. A future request schema version **MAY** remove redundant fields only at an explicit version boundary; v1 will not be mutated in place. Migration and versioning details will be decided if a future revision is proposed.

When authentication is enforced, an unknown Action or workflow cannot satisfy the stored-proposer or eligible-signer requirement. An enforcing Coordination Service therefore returns `403 permission_denied` for an unknown `workflow-cancel` target or Approval workflow rather than revealing existence with `404`. With enforcement disabled, the existing Coordination Service `404 ACTION_NOT_FOUND` behavior is unchanged.

##### 4.6.4.3 Verifier

`POST /mpas/v1/verifier/action` is the shared logical Action interface defined in §6. This subsection applies when a directly reachable Verifier hosts that endpoint; §4.6.4.1 applies when an Action Relay hosts it.

For `DeliveryEnvelope<ActionRequest>`, signature `keyid` **MUST** equal `DeliveryEnvelope.sender` and the enclosed `ActionEnvelope.proposer.did`. For bare `ActionRequest`, signature `keyid` **MUST** equal the enclosed `ActionEnvelope.proposer.did`. HTTP authentication establishes request provenance; it is not an Approval and does not replace MPAS policy evaluation.

##### 4.6.4.4 Signer

Identity binding for `POST /mpas/v1/approval-request` is not yet defined. Until this section is specified, a Signer endpoint that adopts §4.6 authentication establishes caller identity for rate limiting and audit only — with no effect on the Signer's approval decision.

#### 4.6.5 Enforcement

The **trust boundary** is the operator-defined set of components and administrative principals within which unauthenticated participant identity claims are accepted. Authentication **MAY** be disabled only if every caller able to reach that service is trusted to make any participant claim the instance accepts, or equivalent isolation prevents cross-participant access. Access to participant keys is relevant evidence in deployment assessment but does not define the boundary. Network placement alone does not define it. Outside this boundary, authentication is enforced as stated below.

Enforcement requirements by role:

- An **Action Relay** or **Coordination Service** outside the trust boundary **MUST** enforce authentication.
- Any other **MPAS endpoint** (Verifier or Signer) outside that boundary **MAY** enforce authentication. Identity binding for those interfaces remains limited as specified in §4.6.4.3 and §4.6.4.4.

A fresh hosted Action Relay or Coordination Service outside the trust boundary **MUST** default enforcement on and **MUST NOT** be exposed unenforced. Existing deployments use a coordinated cutover so callers sign before enforcement is enabled.

Production HTTPS remains independently required by §4.1. TLS protects transport but does not replace authentication when this section requires enforcement.

Configuration **MUST** fail closed: enforcement enabled with an empty configured audience set or any configured value that is not a valid origin **MUST** refuse to start.

Health-check endpoints (`GET /mpas/v1/relay/health`, `GET /mpas/v1/coordination/health`, and equivalents) **SHOULD** remain unauthenticated so deployment probes and monitoring continue to function.

#### 4.6.6 Error Responses

When enforcement is enabled, a request with no signature headers returns `401 authentication_required`. A request that presents signature headers but fails candidate selection; has malformed input or a missing or wrong required signature parameter, including `tag`; has an invalid or mismatched key; fails cryptographic verification; or fails freshness, nonce, or audience validation uniformly returns `401 signature_invalid`. This prevents an attacker from distinguishing signature-validation failure modes. A `Content-Digest` mismatch remains `400 artifact_hash_mismatch`, and an authenticated caller that is not authorized for the requested operation remains `403 permission_denied`.

Failures **MUST NOT** disclose whether a DID exists or has pending work.

| Condition | Status | Code |
|---|---|---|
| Signature headers absent while enforcing | 401 | `authentication_required` |
| Presented-signature selection, required-parameter or tag, key, cryptographic, freshness, nonce, or audience failure | 401 | `signature_invalid` |
| `Content-Digest` mismatch | 400 | `artifact_hash_mismatch` |
| Authenticated but not authorized for the requested operation | 403 | `permission_denied` |
| Required Coordination Service identity representations are not all equal | 403 | `permission_denied` |

Signature values, `Signature-Input`, `keyid`, nonce values, and body content **MUST NOT** be logged by application, framework, or error logging. A logged `Signature` header is a replayable credential for the duration of the freshness window.

#### 4.6.7 Applicability

This profile is the sole MPAS participant authentication mechanism defined by this HTTP profile. Enforcement requirements per role are in §4.6.5. Future versions may define additional mechanisms; until then, implementations that authenticate **MUST** use this profile.

### 4.7 HTTP Status Codes vs MPAS Result Codes

HTTP status codes describe transport/API processing. MPAS result values describe protocol outcomes.

A policy rejection is not an HTTP authorization failure. For example, a Verifier that successfully evaluates an Action Package and rejects it under policy should generally return:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/mpas+json
```

with an `ActionResponse` body containing:

```json
{
  "result": "rejected"
}
```

For example, a Verifier implementing the JSON Verifier Policy Profile returns a matched blocked-action rule synchronously as:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/mpas+json

{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "ActionResponse",
  "result": "rejected",
  "error": {
    "code": "ACTION_BLOCKED_BY_POLICY",
    "message": "Action github.delete_repository is blocked by policy."
  }
}
```

This is a deterministic MPAS protocol rejection, not an HTTP authorization failure. The response MUST NOT include Authorization Requirements, and the Verifier MUST NOT dispatch the action.

### 4.8 Standard HTTP Status Mapping

|                  HTTP Status | Meaning                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|                     `200 OK` | Request was processed. The MPAS protocol result is in the response body.                                     |
|                `201 Created` | Coordination state, approval record, subscription, or similar resource was created.                          |
|               `202 Accepted` | Request was accepted for asynchronous processing.                                                            |
|            `400 Bad Request` | Invalid HTTP request shape, invalid JSON, missing required HTTP-level fields.                                |
|           `401 Unauthorized` | HTTP authentication missing or invalid.                                                                      |
|              `403 Forbidden` | Authenticated caller is not allowed to use the endpoint or see the requested coordination state.             |
|              `404 Not Found` | Requested coordination object, action, approval request, or relay cursor was not found or not visible to caller. |
|               `409 Conflict` | Idempotency conflict, duplicate submission conflict, or same `actionId` with different `actionEnvelopeHash`. |
|                   `410 Gone` | Resource expired or no longer available under retention policy.                                              |
| `415 Unsupported Media Type` | Unsupported content type.                                                                                    |
|   `422 Unprocessable Entity` | JSON was syntactically valid, but MPAS artifact was structurally invalid or not canonicalizable.             |
|      `429 Too Many Requests` | Rate limit.                                                                                                  |
|  `500 Internal Server Error` | Unexpected server error.                                                                                     |
|    `503 Service Unavailable` | Temporary policy, verifier, application, or dependency unavailability.                                       |

### 4.9 Standard Error Envelope

When returning a transport or structural error, implementations **SHOULD** use `MpasHttpError`.

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "MpasHttpError",
  "requestId": "req_123",
  "error": {
    "code": "artifact_hash_mismatch",
    "message": "Execution Payload hash does not match actionEnvelope.executionPayloadHash.",
    "retryable": false,
    "details": [
      {
        "path": "/actionPackage/actionEnvelope/executionPayloadHash",
        "reason": "Expected base64url digest did not match computed digest."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Recommended error codes:

| `artifact_malformed`           | MPAS artifact is malformed.                                                 |
| `artifact_not_canonicalizable` | MPAS artifact cannot be canonicalized.                                      |
| `artifact_hash_mismatch`       | Hash binding does not match the supplied artifact.                          |
| `signature_invalid`            | Signature verification failed. Under §4.6, this also covers HTTP Message Signature failures including expired/future timestamps, replayed nonce, and audience mismatch. |
| `not_supported`                | Target application, operation, signature format, or profile is unsupported. |
| `policy_unavailable`           | Policy could not be loaded or evaluated.                                    |
| `timeout`                      | The endpoint could not obtain a result within its bounded wait. Retryable with the same idempotency key; the timeout itself creates and destroys no protocol state. |
| `expired`                      | Artifact or coordination workflow expired.                                  |

## 5. Common Reference Objects

### 5.1 Hash Object

Hash objects use the core MPAS form:

```json
{
  "alg": "sha-256",
  "value": "base64url-encoded-digest"
}
```

JSON objects that are hashed or signed **MUST** be canonicalized using the canonicalization rules defined by the core MPAS specification.

### 5.2 ActionRef

`ActionRef` is a typed convenience object used by HTTP and coordination messages to refer to an existing workflow or Action Envelope.

`ActionRef` is not a core authorization artifact. It does not replace the Action Envelope, Approval, Approval Bundle, Authorization Requirements, or Execution Receipt bindings.

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "ActionRef",
  "actionId": {
    "scope": "optional-replay-domain",
    "value": "urn:uuid:3f82f6e1-135e-44c5-90a9-58f760f6d9f1"
  },
  "actionEnvelopeHash": {
    "alg": "sha-256",
    "value": "base64url-encoded-digest"
  }
}
```

Fields:

| Field                | Required | Description                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | :------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`            |   Yes    | MUST be `"1"`.                                                                               |
| `type`               |   Yes    | MUST be `ActionRef`.                                                                         |
| `actionId`           |   Yes    | The workflow and replay identifier from the Action Envelope.                                 |
| `actionEnvelopeHash` |   Yes    | The immutable proposal binding (hash of the Action Envelope).                                |

Rules:

- `actionId` is the workflow and replay identifier from the Action Envelope.
- `actionEnvelopeHash` is the immutable proposal binding.
- Coordination Services **MAY** index workflows by `actionId`.
- Coordination Services **MUST** compute `actionEnvelopeHash` from the received Action Envelope.
- Once a Coordination Service has observed a binding from `actionId` to `actionEnvelopeHash`, a later submission with the same `actionId` and different `actionEnvelopeHash` **MUST** be rejected with `409 Conflict`, unless the deployment explicitly defines a supersession mechanism using a new Action Envelope and new Action ID.
- Authorization Requirements **MUST NOT** rely on `ActionRef`; they bind directly to `actionEnvelopeHash`.

### 5.3 Participant Reference

Participant references identify MPAS actors such as Proposers, Signers, Verifiers, Applications, or auditors. An Action Relay or Coordination Service is not a participant merely because it transports messages or hosts workflow state.

```json
{
  "did": "did:web:alice.example"
}
```

Implementations **MAY** include non-authoritative routing hints:

```json
{
  "did": "did:web:alice.example",
  "endpoint": "https://alice.example/mpas/v1/approval-request"
}
```

Routing hints are not authorization.

### 5.4 Optional Service Discovery

Implementations **MAY** expose service discovery at:

```http
GET /.well-known/mpas.json
```

Service discovery is optional. Deployments **MAY** configure endpoints out-of-band.

Service discovery can help clients learn:

- service role: Verifier, Signer, Action Relay, Coordination Service, or multiple roles;
- supported MPAS HTTP profile versions;
- supported artifact versions;
- supported signature formats;
- endpoint paths;
- service DID;
- sync, async, polling, callback, and webhook capabilities.

Service discovery metadata is not policy, not an Approval, and not authorization.

An Action Relay or Coordination Service does not require a DID. `serviceDid` is present only when the service separately has and advertises a participant or service identity.

Example:

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "MpasServiceDescription",
  "serviceDid": "did:web:verifier.example",
  "roles": ["verifier"],
  "profiles": ["mpas-http-action-approval-coordination-v1"],
  "artifactVersions": ["1"],
  "signatureFormats": ["jws", "eip712"],
  "endpoints": {
    "action": "https://verifier.example/mpas/v1/verifier/action"
  },
  "capabilities": {
    "syncActionResponse": true,
    "asyncActionResponse": true,
    "polling": false
  }
}
```

### 5.5 DeliveryEnvelope

`DeliveryEnvelope` is routing metadata around an MPAS message or artifact. It does not assign an MPAS role and does not replace verification of its payload.

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "DeliveryEnvelope",
  "sender": "did:jwk:...sender...",
  "recipients": ["did:jwk:...recipient..."],
  "createdAt": "2026-08-25T12:00:00.000Z",
  "expiresAt": "2026-08-25T12:05:00.000Z",
  "audience": "https://coordination.example.com",
  "payload": {
    "version": "1",
    "type": "ActionRequest"
  }
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| `version` | Yes | MUST be `"1"`. |
| `type` | Yes | MUST be `DeliveryEnvelope`. |
| `sender` | Yes | DID of the participant responsible for the payload's recorded provenance. |
| `recipients` | Yes | Non-empty array of unique recipient DIDs. |
| `createdAt` | Yes | MPAS Core §5 timestamp: RFC 3339 UTC with exactly three fractional digits and a `Z` suffix. |
| `expiresAt` | Optional | MPAS Core §5 timestamp and retrieval deadline later than `createdAt`. |
| `audience` | Conditional | Receiving service origin when the envelope is the signed HTTP request body (§4.6.3). |
| `payload` | Yes | JSON representation of the applicable MPAS message or artifact. |

An Action Relay creates an independent retrieval obligation for each authorized recipient. Retrieval by one recipient does not consume another recipient's delivery. Routing uses the explicit recipient list and does not inspect the payload to infer recipients or roles. A participant-authored signed submission establishes `keyid == sender`; the envelope is not an end-to-end signature.

A receiving endpoint **MUST** reject an envelope whose `expiresAt` is not in the future at submission, before creating any delivery obligation. Implementations **SHOULD** enforce a finite deployment-specific recipient-count limit to bound authorization work and delivery fan-out.

Every recipient receives the complete envelope and therefore learns the complete `recipients` array. In multi-tenant deployments, administrator-added recipients are visible to the other recipients carried in that envelope.

The Delivery Envelope equivalence contribution is defined in §4.5.

## 6. Verifier Action Interface

### 6.1 Purpose

The Action Interface is used to submit an Action Package to a logical Verifier endpoint. The endpoint may be hosted by a directly reachable Verifier or by an Action Relay.

The caller is asking the Verifier to process the Action Package and execute the Action if policy is satisfied.

Verification is the deterministic processing step performed by the Verifier. It is not the name of the primary HTTP operation.

### 6.2 Endpoint

| Client   | Endpoint Host          | Method | Endpoint                       | Request                                              | Response         |
| -------- | ---------------------- | -----: | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Proposer | Verifier / Application | `POST` | `/mpas/v1/verifier/action` | `ActionRequest` or `DeliveryEnvelope<ActionRequest>` | `ActionResponse` |
| Proposer | Action Relay           | `POST` | `/mpas/v1/verifier/action` | `DeliveryEnvelope<ActionRequest>`                    | `ActionResponse` |

`POST /mpas/v1/action` is a temporary compatibility alias. The alias and canonical path **MUST** invoke the same handler and share authentication, Action idempotency, dispatch-ledger, relay correlation, and stored response state. New clients **MUST** use `/mpas/v1/verifier/action`.

The Verifier may be embedded in a native MPAS Application or in another MPAS-aware execution component. This profile refers to that endpoint as the Verifier. It does not distinguish Credential Adapter implementations from native MPAS Application implementations at the HTTP protocol level.

### 6.3 ActionRequest

`ActionRequest` carries an MPAS Action Package. A directly reachable Verifier **MUST** accept both a bare `ActionRequest` and `DeliveryEnvelope<ActionRequest>`. An Action Relay **MUST** require the envelope because it supplies routing metadata. A raw `ActionPackage` is not a request form for this endpoint.

A client **SHOULD** always send `DeliveryEnvelope<ActionRequest>`. The enveloped form is accepted by every host of this endpoint, so a client that always uses it works unchanged against a directly reachable Verifier and against an Action Relay, and can be repointed between them without a code change. The bare form remains valid but is a compatibility convenience for deployments that will only ever address a Verifier directly; a client that emits only the bare form cannot be repointed at a relay.

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "ActionRequest",
  "idempotencyKey": "28ebf760-3948-493a-bc46-cc2f18e7172a",
  "actionPackage": {
    "version": "1",
    "type": "ActionPackage"
  },
  "context": {
    "requestPurpose": "initialSubmission"
  }
}
```

Fields:

| Field           | Required | Description                                                                             |
| --------------- | :------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`       |   Yes    | MUST be `"1"`.                                                                          |
| `type`          |   Yes    | MUST be `ActionRequest`.                                                                |
| `actionPackage` |   Yes    | Complete MPAS Action Package.                                                           |
| `idempotencyKey` | Recommended | Action-processing idempotency key (§4.5).                                            |
| `audience`       | Conditional | Action endpoint origin only when this is the outer body of a signed bare request.     |
| `context`       | Optional | Non-authoritative request metadata. MUST NOT override policy or MPAS artifact contents. |

The same endpoint and request type are used for:

- A1 Action Package submission for execution or policy evaluation;
- completed A2 Action Package submission after additional Approvals have been collected for A2;
- an exact retry after transport failure, subject to idempotency and replay rules.

A completed A2 submission is not an idempotent retry or resubmission of A1. A1 and A2 have different Action IDs and Action Envelope hashes, and an Action Relay MUST create and correlate them as independent relay messages. MPAS defines no transport-level continuation link between them.

For enveloped submission, the envelope `sender` and signed `keyid` equal the Action Envelope Proposer DID. A directly reachable Verifier selects its configured Verifier DID locally and requires that DID to occur in `DeliveryEnvelope.recipients`; it does not require itself to be the only recipient and is not responsible for forwarding to other recipients unless it also implements routing.

An Action Relay selects the designated Verifier DID from trusted deployment configuration, requires it among the authorized recipients, records it independently of the recipient list, stores the relayed Action and deliveries, and keeps the request pending until it receives the first qualifying Verifier-authored `ActionResponse` through §8.9. It **MUST NOT** create an approval workflow or synthesize an `ActionResponse` merely to acknowledge relay acceptance. An equivalent idempotent retry waits for or returns the stored Verifier response.

Before storing or exposing a relayed Action, the Action Relay **MUST** verify that the Execution Payload matches `actionEnvelope.executionPayloadHash` and that `approvalBundle.actionEnvelopeHash` matches the computed Action Envelope hash. A mismatch is `400 artifact_hash_mismatch` and creates no delivery.

The relay **MUST** bound how long it holds each HTTP submission open. If the deployment-selected bound expires before a qualifying response arrives, it returns `503 timeout` with `retryable: true`; it **MUST NOT** synthesize an `ActionResponse`. The relayed Action and delivery records survive. An equivalent idempotent retry resumes waiting for, or returns, the same stored Verifier response. This profile does not fix the bound's duration.

A directly reachable Verifier **MAY** return `503 timeout` under the same contract when it cannot obtain a result within its own bounded wait — for example, a slow upstream Application or an unresolved asynchronous policy evaluation. The code names the condition, not the component: it does not tell a client whether it reached a Verifier directly or through a relay, and a client handles it identically in both cases by retrying with the same idempotency key. Retry safety comes from that key and from the Core §6.5.1 dispatch-ledger rules, not from the error code. Which component's wait expired is diagnostic information and belongs in `error.message`, `error.details`, or `context.diagnostic`.

### 6.4 ActionResponse

`ActionResponse` reports the Verifier's protocol result.

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "ActionResponse",
  "verifier": {
    "did": "did:web:verifier.example"
  },
  "actionEnvelopeHash": {
    "alg": "sha-256",
    "value": "base64url-encoded-digest"
  },
  "result": "additionalApprovalsRequired",
  "authorizationRequirements": {
    "version": "1",
    "type": "AuthorizationRequirements"
  },
  "createdAt": "2026-05-31T18:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Fields:

| Field                       |  Required   | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | :---------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`                   |     Yes     | MUST be `"1"`.                                                                                                                                           |
| `type`                      |     Yes     | MUST be `ActionResponse`.                                                                                                                                |
| `verifier.did`              | Recommended | DID of the Verifier returning the response. Required when the response includes Authorization Requirements or Execution Receipt issuer identity matters. |
| `actionEnvelopeHash`        | Recommended | Hash of the Action Envelope, when computable.                                                                                                            |
| `result`                    |     Yes     | Action result value.                                                                                                                                     |
| `authorizationRequirements` | Conditional | Required when `result` is `additionalApprovalsRequired`.                                                                                                 |
| `executionReceipt`          | Conditional | Recommended when the Action is resolved. Required by profiles that require receipts for completed Actions.                                               |
| `executionResult`           |  Optional   | INFORMATIVE execution-profile-native response content (see Section 6.4.1). Not hash-bound, not covered by the receipt signature, not an attestation of output. |
| `error`                     |  Optional   | Machine-readable detail for `rejected`/`failed`/`malformed` results (`{ code, message }`). Distinct from the transport-level `MpasHttpError` (Section 4.9). |
| `actionRequestId`           |  Optional   | Verifier-local identifier for async processing.                                                                                                          |
| `pollAfter`                 |  Optional   | Suggested time after which the caller may poll or retry, if async behavior is supported.                                                                 |
| `context`                   |  Optional   | Non-authoritative explanatory metadata, including profile-defined diagnostics (Section 6.4.2).                                                           |
| `createdAt`                 | Recommended | Response timestamp.                                                                                                                                      |

If both `ActionResponse.actionEnvelopeHash` and `authorizationRequirements.actionEnvelopeHash` are present, they MUST be identical. A client SHOULD reject a response where they differ.

When `authorizationRequirements` is present, `ActionResponse.verifier.did` is required and MUST equal `authorizationRequirements.verifier.did`. On an authenticated direct response or relay delivery, the response-level DID is bound to the authenticated Verifier for that hop. The nested DID does not retain that authority after a Proposer copies it into a newly authored Coordination object.

#### 6.4.1 executionResult (Informative)

`executionResult` carries the execution-profile-native response content the target produced. For `mcp.toolsCall`, it is the target MCP server's `tools/call` result object, **verbatim**, so an upper-layer implementation can relay or retain exactly what the target returned. It is INFORMATIVE only: it is not hash-bound, not covered by the Execution Receipt signature, and not an attestation of output (the MCP Execution Profile §7 reserves output commitment as future work). This profile does not define how or when an upper-layer interface delivers that material to its client.

Presence rule:

- `result: executed` → `executionResult` present, verbatim target response.
- `result: failed` where the target returned a tool-level failure (`isError: true`) → `executionResult` present, verbatim — this is a normal MCP tool response the agent is built to handle.
- `result: failed` from a JSON-RPC/protocol error, and all pure-MPAS outcomes (`additionalApprovalsRequired`, `pending`, `rejected`, `expired`, `malformed`, `indeterminate`) → `executionResult` ABSENT; a bridge synthesizes a response for the agent, since the real server would never have produced these outcomes.

#### 6.4.2 context.diagnostic (Informative)

`context.diagnostic` carries sanitized, machine-readable information about where and how processing failed. It is INFORMATIVE and non-authoritative: it is not hash-bound, is not covered by the Execution Receipt signature, and MUST NOT override or contradict `result`, an Execution Receipt, Authorization Requirements, or any other MPAS artifact.

```json
{
  "context": {
    "diagnostic": {
      "code": "DISPATCH_TIMEOUT",
      "phase": "tools/call",
      "transport": "stdio",
      "message": "The upstream server did not respond before the dispatch timeout."
    }
  }
}
```

| Field       | Required | Description |
| ----------- | :------: | ----------- |
| `code`      |   Yes    | Stable machine-readable diagnostic code. Execution profiles SHOULD define interoperable values. |
| `phase`     | Optional | Profile-defined processing phase in which the condition occurred. |
| `transport` | Optional | Profile- or deployment-defined transport identifier. |
| `message`   | Optional | Sanitized human-readable explanation suitable for logs and agent-facing error reporting. |

A Verifier SHOULD include `context.diagnostic` when a `failed`, `indeterminate`, or transient pre-dispatch response would otherwise be difficult to operate or reconcile. Diagnostic metadata MUST NOT change retry, idempotency, or lifecycle rules. In particular, a diagnostic on `result: indeterminate` does not make the same `actionId` safe to retry.

Diagnostic content MUST be sanitized and resource-bounded. It MUST NOT contain credentials, authorization headers, environment-variable values, secrets, tokens, private keys, raw command arguments, or raw process output. Implementations MUST ignore unknown diagnostic fields and codes without changing their interpretation of `result`.

### 6.5 ActionResponse Result Values

| Result                        | Meaning                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `executed`                    | The Action was authorized and executed. An Execution Receipt SHOULD be present.                                                                           |
| `additionalApprovalsRequired` | The Action Package does not satisfy current policy. Authorization Requirements SHOULD be present as advisory input from which the Proposer may construct a replacement Action. |
| `rejected`                    | The Verifier rejected the Action, including a deterministic policy block. An Execution Receipt SHOULD be present if the Action is resolved.                 |
| `notSupported`                | The Verifier does not support the requested Application, operation, payload format, or verification mode.                                                 |
| `malformed`                   | The Action Package is structurally invalid, not canonicalizable, or has invalid hash bindings.                                                            |
| `policyUnavailable`           | The Verifier cannot determine applicable policy at this time.                                                                                             |
| `pending`                     | The action has been accepted and is executing or awaiting execution. No second dispatch will occur for an identical retry.                                 |
| `failed`                      | Execution was attempted but failed definitively. An Execution Receipt SHOULD be present.                                                                  |
| `indeterminate`               | Execution was dispatched but the outcome could not be confirmed. An Execution Receipt SHOULD be present.                                                  |
| `expired`                     | The Action expired before execution. An Execution Receipt SHOULD be present.                                                                              |
| `cancelled`                   | The Action was cancelled before execution. Reserved for verifier-side signed cancellation (Core Section 6.9.6); not produced by dispatch in this version. An Execution Receipt SHOULD be present. |

Implementations **MAY** define additional application-specific result values, but portable clients should not depend on unknown values.

#### 6.5.1 Derivation from Core Action Lifecycle

The ActionResponse `result` values are a projection of the Core Action Lifecycle (Core Section 6.9), which is a **dispatch ledger**: verification is stateless and a ledger entry exists only once an action is authorized for dispatch.

| Wire Result                   | Core Lifecycle Mapping                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pending`                     | `executing` ledger entry — dispatch is in progress; an identical retry triggers no second dispatch.                          |
| `additionalApprovalsRequired` | Stateless response — no ledger entry; verification deterministically reports unmet policy. A conforming client retires this Action ID after receiving the response. |
| `rejected`                    | Stateless response — no ledger entry; deterministic rejection (invalid signature, unknown application, disabled operation, resource restriction, policy denial). Repeatable. |
| `expired`                     | Stateless response — no ledger entry; the envelope is past `expiresAt`. Repeatable.                                            |
| `malformed`                   | Stateless response — no ledger entry; artifact-level structural failure inside a hashable package.                            |
| `policyUnavailable`           | Stateless response — no ledger entry; transient.                                                                              |
| `notSupported`                | Stateless response — no ledger entry.                                                                                         |
| `executed`                    | `resolved(executed)` ledger entry — terminal.                                                                                 |
| `failed`                      | `resolved(failed)` ledger entry — terminal.                                                                                   |
| `indeterminate`               | `resolved(indeterminate)` ledger entry — terminal. Callers MUST NOT auto-retry; reconciliation is out of band.               |

**Idempotency and `pending`:** When a Verifier receives an identical retry (same `actionId`, same envelope hash) whose ledger entry is `executing`, it MUST return `pending` and MUST NOT transmit again. This ties the HTTP profile's Idempotency-Key guidance to the Core lifecycle: the idempotency guarantee is that an `executing` action cannot be double-dispatched. A submission with the same `actionId` but a different envelope hash, or against a `resolved` entry, MUST be rejected.

Before an `ActionResponse` is received, a transport retry or retryable `503 timeout` repeats the exact request with the same Action ID and idempotency key. After receiving `additionalApprovalsRequired` or `rejected`, a conforming client MUST NOT submit any subsequent Action Package that reuses that Action ID. For additional approvals it constructs a new Action, not a retry, and uses a new idempotency key.

  },

}
```

### 6.8 Execution Receipt Return Behavior

The Verifier returns the Execution Receipt to the caller of `/mpas/v1/verifier/action`.

Participants MAY retrieve receipts from the Verifier, from a Coordination Service that has received them, or from any other service that stores them. How receipts propagate beyond the initial response is deployment-specific.

This profile does not require a separate receipt retrieval endpoint. Future profiles or deployments MAY define one.

### 6.9 Async Action Behavior

A Verifier **MAY** process Actions asynchronously.

Example async response:

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "ActionResponse",
  "verifier": {
    "did": "did:web:verifier.example"
  },
  "actionEnvelopeHash": {
    "alg": "sha-256",
    "value": "base64url-encoded-digest"
  },
  "result": "pending",
  "actionRequestId": "arq_123",
  "pollAfter": "2026-05-31T18:01:00.000Z",
  "createdAt": "2026-05-31T18:00:02.000Z"
}
```

Async completion may be delivered by deployment-specific polling, callback, webhook, Action Relay, or Coordination Service mechanisms.

## 7. Signer Approval Interface

### 7.1 Purpose

The Signer Approval Interface is used to ask a Signer to produce an MPAS Approval decision for a Signer Review Set.

The core MPAS object provided to the Signer is still the `SignerReviewSet`. The HTTP transport message is called an `ApprovalRequest` because the requester is asking for an Approval decision.

### 7.2 Endpoint

| Client                           | Endpoint Host | Method | Endpoint                    | Request           | Response           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------- | -----: | --------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Proposer or Coordination Service | Signer        | `POST` | `/mpas/v1/approval-request` | `ApprovalRequest` | `ApprovalResponse` |

The endpoint path does not include the component name `signer` because the host identifies the service role. Deployments **MAY** expose role-prefixed aliases, but the canonical endpoint is `/mpas/v1/approval-request`.

### 7.3 ApprovalRequest

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "ApprovalRequest",
  "signerReviewSet": {
    "version": "1",
    "type": "SignerReviewSet"
  },
  "requestedDecision": "approve",
  "returnMode": "sync",
  "context": {
    "message": "Approval requested for production deployment."
  }
}
```

Fields:

| Field               | Required | Description                                                         |

| `requestedDecision` | Optional | Requested decision.                                                 |
| `returnMode`        | Optional | `sync` or `async`. Defaults to deployment behavior.                 |
| `context`           | Optional | Non-authoritative explanatory metadata.                             |

### 7.4 ApprovalResponse

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "ApprovalResponse",
  "status": "completed",
  "approval": {
    "version": "1",
    "type": "Approval"
  },
  "createdAt": "2026-05-31T18:10:00.000Z"
}
```

Fields:

| Field               |  Required   | Description                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | :---------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`           |     Yes     | MUST be `"1"`.                                                                                       |
| `type`              |     Yes     | MUST be `ApprovalResponse`.                                                                          |
| `status`            |     Yes     | Transport/process status of the approval request.                                                    |
| `approval`          | Conditional | Required when `status` is `completed`. Contains the MPAS Approval object with the Signer's decision. |
| `approvalRequestId` |  Optional   | Signer-local request identifier for async review.                                                    |
| `context`           |  Optional   | Non-authoritative explanatory metadata.                                                              |
| `createdAt`         | Recommended | Response timestamp.                                                                                  |

Status values:

| Status         | Meaning                                                                                                                   | `approval` present? |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `completed`    | Signer produced an Approval. The Signer's decision (`approve`, `reject`, `abstain`, `propose`) is in `approval.decision`. | Yes                 |
| `pending`      | Human, custody, hardware, or async review is pending.                                                                     | No                  |
| `declined`     | Signer declined to participate without producing an Approval.                                                             | No                  |
| `malformed`    | Signer Review Set is structurally invalid or cannot be verified.                                                          | No                  |
| `notSupported` | Signer does not support the requested signature format or artifact version.                                               | No                  |
| `expired`      | Action Envelope or request expired before the Signer could respond.                                                       | No                  |
| `failed`       | Review failed for another reason.                                                                                         | No                  |

The `status` field describes what happened at the transport/process level. The Signer's actual decision (`approve`, `reject`, `abstain`) is expressed only in the embedded `approval.decision` field, which is the signed, authoritative artifact. The `status` field MUST NOT be used to infer the Signer's decision.

A Signer's `reject` decision is valid workflow and audit feedback. It does not by itself block execution unless the Verifier's policy independently determines rejection. Policy SHOULD NOT depend on collecting `reject` Approvals because a Proposer-assembled bundle can omit them.

### 7.5 Signer Verification Requirements

Before producing an Approval, a Signer **MUST** verify that the Execution Payload matches the Action Envelope's `executionPayloadHash`.

A Signer **SHOULD** verify:

- Action Envelope structure;
- Action Envelope expiration;
- Action Envelope canonicalizability;
- target information from the Action Envelope, execution profile, profile-derived operation/tool/command identity, profile-native payload fields, Proposer DID, Action ID, and expiration;
- any Authorization Requirements included for context;
- whether the requested decision is within the Signer's authority.

Signer Review Sets are not authorization artifacts and do not need to be signed by the Coordination Service.

A Signer **MUST NOT** approve if the Execution Payload is missing, unavailable, or cannot be verified against the Action Envelope.

### 7.6 Async Signer Review

If a human, hardware device, custody workflow, or policy signer cannot respond immediately, the Signer endpoint may return:

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "ApprovalResponse",
  "status": "pending",
  "approvalRequestId": "apr_123",
  "createdAt": "2026-05-31T18:10:00.000Z"
}
```

Async completion may be handled through a Coordination Service poll, callback, webhook, or deployment-specific mechanism.

## 8. Action Relay and Coordination Service Interfaces

### 8.1 Purpose and separation

An Action Relay and a Coordination Service are independent optional services.

An Action Relay routes a Proposer's enveloped Action request to a configured Verifier and returns that Verifier's response. A Coordination Service creates and tracks an approval workflow only after an explicit client request. Either service may be used without the other.

The services may be co-located, but co-location creates no protocol authority. A relay response **MUST NOT** automatically create a coordination workflow, and a ready coordination workflow **MUST NOT** automatically submit a completed Action Package to a Verifier. The Proposer or its bridge performs both explicit transitions.

### 8.2 Service Trust Boundary

An Action Relay or Coordination Service:

- **MUST NOT** alter Execution Payloads, Action Envelopes, or Approval objects without causing verification failure.
- **MUST NOT** treat chat messages, comments, dashboard clicks, notifications, or transport authentication as MPAS Approvals unless the Verifier's policy explicitly recognizes a corresponding trusted external approval record.
- **MUST NOT** be treated as approval authority unless the Verifier's policy explicitly trusts it for a specific role.
- **SHOULD NOT** hold application credentials, reusable signer credentials, private keys, or downstream application secrets.
- **MAY**, when acting as a Coordination Service, assemble Approval Bundles from unmodified Approvals.

An Action Relay **MUST NOT** use relay records, response provenance, or a shared database to authorize a Coordination Service mutation. A Coordination Service **MUST** apply its own authentication and administrative authorization to an explicit workflow request.

### 8.3 Endpoints

Action Relay endpoints:

| Client | Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Proposer | `POST` | `/mpas/v1/verifier/action` | Submit `DeliveryEnvelope<ActionRequest>` and receive the unchanged Verifier-authored `ActionResponse`. |
| Participant | `POST` | `/mpas/v1/relay/poll` | Poll for addressed deliveries. |
| Verifier | `POST` | `/mpas/v1/relay/delivery` | Return `DeliveryEnvelope<ActionResponse>`. |
| Participant | `POST` | `/mpas/v1/relay/session` | Obtain a relay-notification WebSocket ticket. |
| Participant | `GET` | `/mpas/v1/relay/ws` | Receive `RelayWorkAvailable`. |

Coordination Service endpoints:

| Client | Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Proposer | `POST` | `/mpas/v1/coordination/workflow` | Explicitly create an approval workflow. |
| Participant | `POST` | `/mpas/v1/coordination/poll` | Poll for Approval Requests and action updates. |
| Signer | `POST` | `/mpas/v1/coordination/approval` | Submit an Approval. |
| Proposer | `POST` | `/mpas/v1/coordination/workflow-cancel` | Cancel a pending workflow. |
| Participant | `POST` | `/mpas/v1/coordination/session` | Obtain a workflow-notification WebSocket ticket. |
| Participant | `GET` | `/mpas/v1/coordination/ws` | Receive `CoordinationWorkAvailable`. |

Implementations **MAY** expose unauthenticated relay and coordination health endpoints for deployment probes. These are not protocol endpoints.

A separate receipt endpoint is not required in v0.2. A Verifier returns a receipt in `ActionResponse`; a client may report the result to its workflow service under deployment-specific behavior.

For migration, a Coordination Service **SHOULD** temporarily accept `POST /mpas/v1/coordination/action` as a deprecated alias of `POST /mpas/v1/coordination/workflow`. The alias accepts the same request, returns the same response, and enters the same DID-scoped idempotency domain; it does not create a second workflow or mutation namespace. New clients **MUST** use `/mpas/v1/coordination/workflow`.

#### 8.3.1 POST /mpas/v1/relay/poll

The Relay poll retrieves only addressed `DeliveryEnvelope` objects. It is separate from workflow polling.

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "RelayPollRequest",
  "did": "did:jwk:...participant...",
  "audience": "https://relay.example.com",
  "cursor": "opaque-checkpoint"
}
```

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "RelayPollResponse",
  "deliveries": [
    {
      "version": "1",
      "type": "DeliveryEnvelope",
      "sender": "did:jwk:...sender...",
      "recipients": ["did:jwk:...participant..."],
      "createdAt": "2026-08-29T12:00:00.000Z",
      "payload": { "version": "1", "type": "ActionRequest" }
    }
  ],
  "nextCursor": "opaque-checkpoint"
}
```

The relay **MUST** establish `keyid == did` and return only unexpired envelopes whose `recipients` contains that DID. Delivery is at least once. A repeated cursor may return the same page. Every capped non-empty page **MUST** include a `nextCursor` for its last delivery, including the currently known final page. A client persists the checkpoint only after durably accepting the page.

A routing client parses the envelope before dispatching the payload on its own `type`. A Verifier relay worker conforming to this version **MUST** fail closed without advancing the cursor when a delivery payload is not `ActionRequest`.

#### 8.3.2 Relay notification session

`POST /mpas/v1/relay/session` accepts:

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "RelaySessionRequest",
  "did": "did:jwk:...participant...",
  "audience": "https://relay.example.com"
}
```

After establishing `keyid == did`, the relay returns `RelaySessionResponse` with `websocketUrl`, an opaque single-use DID-bound `ticket`, and `expiresAt`. The URL identifies `/mpas/v1/relay/ws`. The ticket behavior is defined in §9.2.

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "RelaySessionResponse",
  "websocketUrl": "wss://relay.example.com/mpas/v1/relay/ws",
  "ticket": "opaque-single-use-value",
  "expiresAt": "2026-08-29T12:05:00.000Z"
}
```

The participant uses `websocketUrl` exactly as returned and supplies `Authorization: Bearer <ticket>` on the WebSocket upgrade. The ticket is omitted from URLs and logs, atomically consumed, and valid for no more than five minutes.

#### 8.3.3 Migration from the combined delivery binding

During migration, an implementation **MAY**:

- accept `/mpas/v1/action` as the §6 alias;
- accept `/mpas/v1/coordination/delivery` as an alias of `/mpas/v1/relay/delivery`.

These aliases do not combine the services. Relay deliveries are available only from
`/mpas/v1/relay/poll`, and relay notifications use only the relay session and
WebSocket. Coordination polling and notifications contain workflow work only.

Each compatibility binding **MUST** share the canonical operation's storage, authorization, correlation, cursor, nonce, and idempotency behavior. It **MUST NOT** create a second mutation. New clients use the separated endpoints.

### 8.4 POST /mpas/v1/coordination/workflow

Used by a Proposer to submit an Action Package to a Coordination Service for approval collection.

The Coordination Service stores the Action Package and makes it available to eligible Signers for review.

This endpoint is used only after a client has received `additionalApprovalsRequired` for A1 from the logical Verifier, constructed replacement Action A2, and chosen this Coordination Service. The initial Verifier call may have been direct or relayed; that choice does not change this endpoint. The request contains A2 and Proposer-authored Authorization Requirements bound to A2. It does not contain A1 or the Verifier's A1-bound Authorization Requirements.

The version 1 wire discriminants remain `CoordinationActionRequest` and `CoordinationActionResponse`. Renaming the endpoint does not create a second message format or silently revise the version 1 payload schemas.

Request:

```json

Response:

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "CoordinationActionResponse",
  "actionRef": {
    "version": "1",
    "type": "ActionRef",
    "actionId": {

    }
  },
  "state": "awaitingApprovals",
  "createdAt": "2026-05-31T18:00:03.000Z"
}
```

Rules:

- On a signed request, signature `keyid` **MUST** equal `actionPackage.actionEnvelope.proposer.did` before processing; mismatch **MUST** be rejected with `403`.
- The Coordination Service **MUST** compute the Action Envelope hash from the received Action Envelope.
- The Proposer-authored Authorization Requirements **MUST** use `result: additionalApprovalsRequired`.
- Before creating a workflow, it **MUST** verify `actionEnvelope.executionPayloadHash` and `approvalBundle.actionEnvelopeHash`; verify that the Authorization Requirements bind to the enclosed A2 Action Envelope hash and contain a structurally valid intended `verifier.did`; reject expired requirements; and reject duplicate or unachievable `eligibleSigners` threshold sets. A failure creates no workflow. Hash failures use `400 artifact_hash_mismatch`, expired requirements use `409 expired`, and other requirements failures use `400 invalid_request`. This check does not authenticate the Verifier as the object's author or require the Coordination Service to know the Verifier.
- The Proposer DID is not categorically forbidden from `eligibleSigners`. Whether a Proposer Approval counts is determined by the applicable Verifier policy or policy profile.
- The Coordination Service **SHOULD** compute and store the Execution Payload hash and Action Package hash for audit/debugging, but those hashes are not substitutes for the normative Action Envelope binding.
- Proposer-authored `authorizationRequirements` are coordination input, not Verifier authority. The enclosed `verifier.did` identifies the intended Verifier; it does not prove that Verifier authored or endorsed the object. Before exposing review material, the Coordination Service **MUST** apply its own administrative authorization to every candidate recipient. It **MUST NOT** bypass that authorization because it is co-located with an Action Relay or can read relay records.
- `CoordinationActionRequest` has no separate top-level Verifier identity. The Coordination Service **MUST NOT** use the requirements' `verifier.did` for caller authorization, require contact with that Verifier, or infer that the Verifier approved the Proposer-authored requirements.
- If `authorizationRequirements` are provided and the candidates are authorized, the Coordination Service **SHOULD** use them to determine which Signers receive Approval Requests.
- The Coordination Service makes collected Approvals and completed Action Packages available to the Proposer through `/mpas/v1/coordination/poll`.
- The Authorization Requirements do not freeze Verifier policy. The Proposer submits completed A2 to the logical Verifier, which evaluates A2 against its current policy under the existing Core rules.

### 8.5 POST /mpas/v1/coordination/poll

Used by MPAS participants to poll for approval work and action state updates.

Polling is mandatory for Coordination Service interoperability. Participants using a Coordination Service topology **MUST** be able to retrieve pending messages by polling, even when push notifications or webhooks are also supported.

The Coordination Service determines what to return based on the participant DID:

- When authentication is enforced (§4.6), signature `keyid` and the required body `did` **MUST** be equal before processing; mismatch is `403`. The response is scoped to that agreed DID, without prescribing which equal representation is used internally.
- When authentication is not enforced, the participant's DID is the body-supplied `did` field.

- **Signers** receive `approvalRequests` — pending Approval Requests for actions where their DID is listed in `eligibleSigners` and the action is in `awaitingApprovals` state.
- **Proposers** receive `actionUpdates` — state and progress updates for actions they proposed, including completed Action Packages when state is `readyForSubmission`.

A DID that is both a proposer on one action and an eligible signer on another receives both arrays populated in the same response.

| `type`    |   Yes    | MUST be `CoordinationPollRequest`.                          |
| `did`      |   Yes    | DID of the participant polling for work or status updates. Required in request schema v1. On a signed request, signature `keyid` **MUST** equal this field before processing or the server rejects with `403`; the response is scoped to that agreed DID. |
| `audience` | Conditional | Configured service URL origin (§4.6.3). Required whenever the request carries an MPAS signature; MAY be omitted only on an unsigned request to an unenforcing service. |

```

Rules:

- On a signed request, the server **MUST** establish `keyid == did` before processing, reject mismatch with `403`, and scope all returned data to that agreed DID.
- `approvalRequests` contains pending Approval Requests for actions where the DID is listed in `eligibleSigners` and the action is in `awaitingApprovals` state. Cancelled actions are not included.
- `actionUpdates` contains state and progress for actions where the DID is the proposer.
- Every action update includes `expiresAt`, copied unchanged from `ActionEnvelope.expiresAt`. This is the Action's authoritative deadline, not the time at which the Coordination Service noticed or recorded expiration.
- Each action update includes a `progress` object with `required` (threshold count), `collected` (approvals collected so far), and `pending` (eligible DIDs that haven't responded). Not present for cancelled actions.
- When state is `readyForSubmission`, the action update includes the completed `actionPackage`. The Proposer can take this Action Package and submit it directly to the Verifier without further assembly.
- When state is `cancelled`, the action update includes `cancelledAt` and no `progress` or `actionPackage`.
- When state is `rejected`, the action update includes `rejectedAt`. This records when the Coordination Service's non-authoritative workflow view became rejected.
- An action update MUST NOT contain an `expiredAt` field. When and how an implementation marks a workflow expired is internal bookkeeping and is not part of the wire protocol.
- The existing `approvalRequests` and `actionUpdates` arrays may be empty.
Addressed Delivery Envelopes are retrieved from `/mpas/v1/relay/poll`, never from this workflow poll.

### 8.6 POST /mpas/v1/coordination/approval

| `audience`           | Conditional | Configured service URL origin (§4.6.3). Required whenever the request carries an MPAS signature; MAY be omitted only on an unsigned request to an unenforcing service. |

Response:

    }
  },
  "state": "awaitingApprovals",
  "createdAt": "2026-05-31T18:12:00.000Z"
}
```

Rules:

- On a signed request, signature `keyid` **MUST** equal the signer DID decoded from the Approval, and that DID **MUST** be an eligible signer for the referenced workflow before processing; mismatch or ineligibility **MUST** be rejected with `403` before the Approval is stored or counted.
- The Coordination Service **MUST** store Approval objects unmodified.
- The Coordination Service **MAY** perform structural checks, hash checks, duplicate detection, and signature pre-validation.
- Coordination Service pre-validation is not authoritative unless the Verifier explicitly trusts the Coordination Service for that role.
- The Verifier remains responsible for final policy evaluation.
- The Coordination Service **MUST** reject Approvals submitted for cancelled actions with `404`.
- For one `actionEnvelopeHash`, a Signer's first valid additional-approval decision is final. A duplicate with the same decision **MAY** be accepted idempotently but **MUST NOT** inflate threshold counts. A later different decision **MUST** be rejected with `409 Conflict`. Changing a decision requires a new Action Envelope and workflow. The Proposer's initial `propose` Approval is not an additional-approval decision under this rule.

### 8.7 POST /mpas/v1/coordination/workflow-cancel

Used by the original Proposer to cancel a pending coordination workflow that is still awaiting approvals. It does not cancel or reverse the Action at a Verifier or Action Relay.

`POST /mpas/v1/coordination/action-cancel` is a temporary compatibility alias. It accepts the same request, returns the same response, and shares the canonical endpoint's authentication, nonce, idempotency, authorization, and workflow mutation. The version 1 request and response discriminants remain `CoordinationActionCancelRequest` and `CoordinationActionCancelResponse`; this path correction does not introduce duplicate message types.

Request:

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "CoordinationActionCancelRequest",

| `actionId`    |   Yes    | The Action ID identifying the workflow to cancel.                                     |
| `proposerDid` |   Yes    | DID of the proposer requesting cancellation. Required in request schema v1. On a signed request, signature `keyid`, this field, and the stored proposer **MUST** all be equal before processing or the server rejects with `403`. |
| `idempotencyKey` | Recommended | Mutation idempotency key (§4.5).                                                |
| `audience`    | Conditional | Configured service URL origin (§4.6.3). Required whenever the request carries an MPAS signature; MAY be omitted only on an unsigned request to an unenforcing service. |

    }
  },
  "state": "cancelled",
  "cancelledAt": "2026-05-31T18:15:00.000Z"
}
```

Rules:

- On a signed request, the server **MUST** establish `keyid == proposerDid == stored proposer` before processing; any mismatch **MUST** be rejected with `403`.
- Only the original proposer (matching `actionPackage.actionEnvelope.proposer.did`) **MAY** cancel a workflow.
- Cancellation is only allowed when the workflow is in `awaitingApprovals` state. If the workflow is already in `readyForSubmission`, the Coordination Service **MUST** return `409 Conflict`.
- A cancelled workflow **MUST NOT** be served to signers in poll responses.
- Approvals submitted after cancellation **MUST** be rejected with `404`.
- Cancellation is final — a cancelled workflow cannot be reactivated. The proposer must create a new workflow if coordination is still required.
- Returns `404` if the workflow is unknown.
- Returns `403` if the requesting DID does not match the original proposer.

### 8.8 Coordination States

Coordination Services maintain a non-authoritative workflow view of action progress (per MPAS Core Section 6.9.5). Coordination states reflect the Coordination Service's local understanding and MUST NOT be conflated with the Verifier's authoritative lifecycle.

Coordination Services **MAY** use the following state values:

| State                  | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `awaitingApprovals`    | Additional approvals are required.                                                                                                                                     |
| `readyForSubmission`   | Coordination Service has collected enough apparent Approvals to allow the Proposer to submit the completed Action Package. This is not final authorization.              |
| `executed`             | Action was executed successfully.                                                                                                                                      |
| `rejected`             | Action was rejected.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `expired`              | Action expired.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `cancelled`            | Action was cancelled.                                                                                                                                                  |

Coordination Services MUST store and emit `readyForSubmission` for this state.

Coordination `state` and Verifier `ActionResponse.result` are separate typed
contexts. In particular:

- `state: awaitingApprovals` means the Coordination Service is maintaining an
  approval-collection workflow; the Verifier-suggested result that initiated that
  workflow is `additionalApprovalsRequired`.
- `result: pending` means the Verifier has an `executing` dispatch-ledger
  entry. It MUST NOT mean waiting for Approvals.
- `state: readyForSubmission` is a coordination hint only. It is not final
  authorization.
- `state: cancelled` stops only the coordination workflow and MUST NOT be
  interpreted as Verifier `result: cancelled`.

Coordination state is not Verifier policy. How the Coordination Service learns
of final states (`executed`, `rejected`, `expired`) is deployment-specific.
When a state name reuses a Verifier result, its meaning MUST remain consistent
with that result.

Because additional-approval decisions are immutable under §8.6, a Coordination Service **SHOULD** transition its non-authoritative workflow view to `rejected` as soon as no `anyOf` threshold path remains reachable or any `allOf` threshold can no longer be reached with the remaining undecided eligible Signers. The Verifier still performs authoritative policy evaluation.

The Verifier performs authoritative verification when it receives the completed replacement Action Package through the direct or relayed Action interface.

### 8.9 POST /mpas/v1/relay/delivery

This endpoint exists so a Verifier that retrieved a relayed `ActionRequest` through `/relay/poll` can return its Verifier-authored `ActionResponse` to the Action Relay. It is not the initial Action submission path and does not accept arbitrary participant payloads in this version.

The request body is `DeliveryEnvelope<ActionResponse>`. Its `recipients` array **MUST** include the Proposer DID and **SHOULD** include the Maintainer DIDs authorized for the Action. The endpoint **MUST** require `payload.type == "ActionResponse"` and establish:

```text
signature keyid == DeliveryEnvelope.sender
                == ActionResponse.verifier.did
                == relayed Action's recorded Verifier DID
```

The configured Verifier DID is recorded independently when the canonical Action request is accepted. It must have occurred in that request's recipient array, but it need not have been the only recipient. The relay correlates the response by the exact Action identity and hashes; it does not compare commands or parameters. Only a response from the recorded designated Verifier completes the held Action request.

The Action Relay **MUST** reject an additional response recipient unless that DID is authorized by relay administrative policy. Recipient authorization does not make a recipient a Signer or Verifier.

The relay may validate Action identity and hash consistency in an enclosed `AuthorizationRequirements`, but it **MUST NOT** create, authorize, or advance an approval workflow from that response. A later workflow exists only after the Proposer explicitly calls `/mpas/v1/coordination/workflow`.

After durable storage, the endpoint returns:

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "RelayDeliveryResponse",
  "accepted": true,
  "createdAt": "2026-08-25T12:00:01.000Z"
}
```

This response acknowledges delivery to the Action Relay; it is not an Action result. The unchanged Verifier-authored `ActionResponse` completes the pending relayed `/mpas/v1/verifier/action` request and remains pollable for its addressed recipients. The envelope has no body-level idempotency field. An Action Relay **MAY** deduplicate repeated response submissions by authenticated sender plus the exact enclosed payload hash; otherwise retries may create repeated delivery records.

### 8.10 POST /mpas/v1/coordination/session

This endpoint creates a ticket for the optional notification-only WebSocket. Its signed request is:

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "CoordinationSessionRequest",
  "did": "did:jwk:...participant...",
  "audience": "https://coordination.example.com"
}
```

The service establishes `keyid == did`, claims the nonce, and returns:

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "CoordinationSessionResponse",
  "websocketUrl": "wss://coordination.example.com/mpas/v1/coordination/ws",
  "ticket": "opaque-single-use-value",
  "expiresAt": "2026-08-25T12:05:00.000Z"
}
```

The ticket is opaque, unguessable, one-use, DID-bound, omitted from URLs and logs, and valid for no more than five minutes.

The participant uses `websocketUrl` exactly as returned and performs a WebSocket upgrade with `GET`, presenting `Authorization: Bearer <ticket>`. It **MUST NOT** place the ticket in the URL. A successful upgrade returns HTTP `101 Switching Protocols`; an invalid, expired, or previously used ticket returns `401`. The ticket authorizes only the upgrade. After the upgrade, the participant follows §9.2: it waits for `CoordinationWorkAvailable` and then uses the ordinary RFC 9421-authenticated poll. After disconnection, it obtains a new session ticket before reconnecting. Polls and submissions continue to use §4.6.

## 9. Polling and Optional Work Notification

### 9.1 Polling-First Requirement

The Action Relay and Coordination Service interfaces are polling-first.

An Action Relay implementing this profile **MUST** expose `/mpas/v1/relay/poll`. A Coordination Service implementing this profile **MUST** expose `/mpas/v1/coordination/poll`.

Participant clients **MUST** be able to retrieve pending messages by polling the service that owns that work. Relay polling returns addressed Delivery Envelopes; coordination polling returns Approval Requests and action updates.

### 9.2 Optional WebSocket Notification

Action Relays and Coordination Services **MAY** support their respective session and WebSocket bindings in addition to polling. A relay sends:

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "RelayWorkAvailable"
}
```

A Coordination Service sends:

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "type": "CoordinationWorkAvailable"
}
```

The notification contains no URL, cursor, count, `DeliveryEnvelope`, or other MPAS payload. The client polls the HTTPS origin and service interface retained from its signed session request; it does not derive an origin or choose a poll API by rewriting `websocketUrl`.

After binding every authenticated connection, including the first, the service **MUST** send a notification when pollable work already exists for that DID. It **SHOULD** notify after committing new pollable work. Notifications may be duplicated, coalesced, delayed, or lost; the authenticated poll remains authoritative.

Heartbeat, reconnect, backoff, connection limits, email, SMS, mobile push, and local wake-up behavior are deployment choices. Polling remains sufficient for interoperability.

## 10. Security Requirements

### 10.1 Verifier Requirements

A Verifier implementing this profile **MUST**:

- receive a complete Action Package in `ActionRequest`;
- deterministically verify the Execution Payload hash against the Action Envelope;
- compute `actionEnvelopeHash` from the Action Envelope;
- verify that the Approval Bundle binds to the computed Action Envelope hash;
- verify candidate Approvals needed to satisfy or block policy;
- determine policy from trusted configuration, application state, smart contract logic, enterprise policy, or another deterministic trusted source;
- not rely on Proposer-supplied policy fields, unsigned metadata, Action Relay or Coordination Service metadata, or HTTP caller identity as authoritative policy;
- enforce replay and Action ID rules;
- return Authorization Requirements with `actionEnvelopeHash` when additional Approvals may satisfy policy;
- return an Execution Receipt when required by the deployment or profile.

### 10.2 Signer Requirements

A Signer implementing this profile **MUST**:

- verify that the Execution Payload matches the Action Envelope's `executionPayloadHash` before approving;
- produce Approvals that bind to `actionEnvelopeHash`;
- not approve if the Execution Payload is missing, unavailable, or does not match the Action Envelope;
- avoid relying only on untrusted summaries or coordination metadata.

### 10.3 Action Relay Requirements

An Action Relay implementing this profile **MUST**:

- authenticate callers under §4.6 when outside the trust boundary;
- select and record the designated Verifier from trusted configuration;
- isolate delivery retrieval by authenticated recipient DID;
- correlate a Verifier response by exact Action identity and hashes;
- preserve the Verifier-authored `ActionResponse` unchanged;
- treat recipient membership as delivery authorization only; and
- never create or advance an approval workflow from relay state.

### 10.4 Coordination Service Requirements

A Coordination Service implementing this profile **MUST**:

- authenticate callers using the RFC 9421 authentication profile (§4.6) when outside the trust boundary;
- store and forward core MPAS artifacts without alteration;
- compute and store `actionEnvelopeHash` for received Action Packages;
- reject same-`actionId`, different-`actionEnvelopeHash` conflicts unless a supersession mechanism is explicitly defined;
- expose polling for participants;
- create a workflow only from an explicit workflow request;
- apply its own administrative authorization before exposing review material, without relying on relay state;
- return a completed Action Package to the Proposer rather than automatically submitting it to a Verifier;
- treat Coordination Service state, comments, notifications, routing, and HTTP authentication as non-authoritative for MPAS approval;
- not treat itself as approval authority unless explicitly trusted by Verifier policy for a specific role;
- not hold downstream application credentials in the ordinary Coordination Service role.

### 10.5 Credential and Application Secret Handling

This profile refers only to the Verifier at the HTTP layer. A Verifier may be embedded in a native MPAS Application or another MPAS-aware component.

Any component that holds or uses application credentials **MUST**:

- use credentials only after the Action Package satisfies Verifier policy;
- bind credential use to the approved Execution Payload;
- not expose reusable credentials to Proposers, Signers, agents, Action Relays, or Coordination Services;
- select credentials from trusted configuration, not from Proposer-supplied payload fields or unsigned metadata.

## 11. Conformance Requirements

### 11.1 Verifier / Application Conformance

A conforming Verifier / Application endpoint **MUST** support:

- `POST /mpas/v1/verifier/action`;
- `DeliveryEnvelope<ActionRequest>` and bare `ActionRequest`;
- `ActionResponse`;
- `application/mpas+json`;
- deterministic MPAS artifact verification;
- `additionalApprovalsRequired` responses with Authorization Requirements bound by `actionEnvelopeHash`;
- final or non-final ActionResponse result values defined in this profile.

### 11.2 Signer Conformance

A conforming Signer endpoint **MUST** support:

- `POST /mpas/v1/approval-request`;
- `ApprovalRequest`;
- `ApprovalResponse`;
- verification of Execution Payload hash before Approval creation;
- production or return of a valid MPAS Approval when approving, rejecting, or abstaining.

### 11.3 Action Relay Conformance

A conforming Action Relay **MUST** support:

- RFC 9421 authentication and identity binding under §4.6;
- `POST /mpas/v1/verifier/action` with `DeliveryEnvelope<ActionRequest>`;
- `POST /mpas/v1/relay/poll`;
- `POST /mpas/v1/relay/delivery` for `DeliveryEnvelope<ActionResponse>`;
- rejection of already-expired envelopes before delivery creation;
- a bounded relay wait returning retryable `503 timeout` without deleting durable state;
- independent recipient obligations and delivery-position cursor checkpoints; and
- exact response correlation without workflow creation.

During migration it **SHOULD** support the compatibility endpoint aliases in §8.3.3.

### 11.4 Coordination Service Conformance

A conforming Coordination Service **MUST** support:

- RFC 9421 authentication profile (§4.6) — deterministic signature selection, signature verification, identity binding, freshness, atomic nonce claiming after validation and before mutation, signed-request audience validation, fail-closed configuration, generic external failures, and logging redaction;
- `POST /mpas/v1/coordination/workflow`;
- `POST /mpas/v1/coordination/poll`;
- `POST /mpas/v1/coordination/approval`;
- `POST /mpas/v1/coordination/workflow-cancel`;
- storage of unmodified Approvals;
- first-decision-final handling for additional-approval decisions;
- Action Package hash-binding and requirements validation before workflow creation;
- conflict detection for same `actionId` with different `actionEnvelopeHash`;
- assembly of completed Action Packages for proposer retrieval via poll.

It **MUST NOT** create a workflow from relay state or automatically submit a completed package to a Verifier.

During the migration period, it **SHOULD** also support the deprecated `/mpas/v1/coordination/action` alias defined in §8.3 and `/mpas/v1/coordination/action-cancel` alias defined in §8.7.

## 12. Direct Flow: Low-Impact Action

The simplest flow does not require a Coordination Service or additional Signers.

```text
Proposer -> Verifier: ActionRequest(initial ActionPackage)
Verifier -> Proposer: ActionResponse(executed + ExecutionReceipt)
```

Steps:

1. Proposer constructs Execution Payload.
2. Proposer constructs Action Envelope with `executionPayloadHash` and `actionId`.
3. Proposer creates its own Approval.
4. Proposer assembles initial Approval Bundle.
5. Proposer submits ActionRequest to `/mpas/v1/verifier/action`.
6. Verifier verifies the package.
7. If the Proposer's Approval satisfies policy, Verifier executes the Action.
8. Verifier returns ActionResponse with Execution Receipt.

---

## 13. Direct Flow: Additional Signer Approvals

This flow uses direct calls to Signers and does not require a Coordination Service.

```text
Proposer -> Verifier: ActionRequest(A1 ActionPackage, Action ID 1, hash H1)
Verifier -> Proposer: ActionResponse(additionalApprovalsRequired + H1-bound AuthorizationRequirements)

Proposer retires A1 and constructs A2 with Action ID 2 and hash H2.
Proposer authors H2-bound AuthorizationRequirements for A2.

Proposer -> Signer A: ApprovalRequest(A2 SignerReviewSet)
Signer A -> Proposer: ApprovalResponse(Approval)

Proposer -> Signer B: ApprovalRequest(A2 SignerReviewSet)
Signer B -> Proposer: ApprovalResponse(Approval)

Proposer assembles A2 Approval Bundle.

Proposer -> Verifier: ActionRequest(completed A2 ActionPackage)
Verifier -> Proposer: ActionResponse(executed + ExecutionReceipt)
```

Rules:

- The Verifier's advisory Authorization Requirements bind to H1.
- The Proposer-authored coordination Authorization Requirements bind to H2.
- Signers receive A2's Execution Payload and Action Envelope in a Signer Review Set.
- Signers verify the Execution Payload hash before approving.
- Approvals bind to H2.
- The Proposer includes collected Approvals in a completed Approval Bundle.
- The Verifier evaluates A2 against current policy and performs final authorization and execution.

## 14. Relay and Coordination Topologies

This appendix describes neutral relay and coordination topologies. It is informative except where it references normative endpoint behavior defined above.

### 14.1 Direct-to-Verifier Initial Submission

```text
Proposer -> Verifier: ActionRequest or DeliveryEnvelope(ActionRequest)
Verifier -> Proposer: ActionResponse
```

The direct-to-Verifier topology remains a first-class MPAS topology. A Verifier accepts both request forms defined in §6. When the request is enveloped, the Verifier requires its configured DID among `recipients`, but it need not be the only recipient. Unless the Verifier also implements routing, the Proposer remains responsible for delivery to any other recipients.

If the Verifier returns `additionalApprovalsRequired` for A1, the Proposer retires A1, constructs A2 with a new Action ID and Action Envelope hash, authors A2-bound Authorization Requirements, and may continue through `/mpas/v1/coordination/workflow` as described in §8.4:

```text
Proposer -> Coordination Service: CoordinationActionRequest(A2 ActionPackage + H2-bound AuthorizationRequirements)
Coordination Service -> Proposer: CoordinationActionResponse(awaitingApprovals)
```

### 14.2 Action-Relayed Initial Submission

```text
Proposer -> Action Relay: DeliveryEnvelope(ActionRequest, configured Verifier among recipients)
Action Relay -> Verifier: RelayPollResponse(deliveries: [DeliveryEnvelope(ActionRequest)])
Verifier -> Action Relay: DeliveryEnvelope(ActionResponse)
Action Relay -> Proposer: unchanged Verifier-authored ActionResponse
```

The Action Relay resolves the designated Verifier DID from trusted deployment configuration, requires it among the authorized envelope recipients, and records it independently. Other recipients do not become Verifiers or Signers merely by receiving the envelope. An `additionalApprovalsRequired` response ends this relay exchange; it does not create a workflow.

If the client chooses approval coordination, it constructs A2 and next performs the same explicit workflow request shown in §14.1. That Coordination Service may be operated separately and applies its own authorization. A2 is a new relay submission later; it is not correlated to A1 by the relay.

### 14.3 Signer Polling

```text
Signer -> Coordination Service: CoordinationPollRequest(did)
Coordination Service -> Signer: CoordinationPollResponse(approvalRequests: [...])
Signer -> Coordination Service: CoordinationApprovalSubmission(actionEnvelopeHash, Approval)
```

The Coordination Service generates Approval Requests from:

- A2's Execution Payload;
- A2's Action Envelope;
- the Proposer-authored Authorization Requirements bound to A2;
- non-authoritative coordination context.

The Signer must still verify the Execution Payload hash against the Action Envelope before approving.

### 14.4 Completed Action Submission

```text
Proposer -> Coordination Service: CoordinationPollRequest(did)
Coordination Service -> Proposer: CoordinationPollResponse(actionUpdates: [readyForSubmission + completed A2 ActionPackage])
Proposer -> logical Verifier: ActionRequest or DeliveryEnvelope(ActionRequest)
logical Verifier -> Proposer: ActionResponse(executed + ExecutionReceipt)
```

The Proposer or its bridge explicitly submits completed A2 to the same configured logical Verifier interface used for A1. This is A2's first Verifier submission. If that endpoint is an Action Relay, the internal exchange repeats §14.2 as an independent relay message with A2's Action ID, hash, Delivery Envelope, and idempotency key. The Coordination Service does not submit or deliver the package to the Verifier.

### 14.5 Direct-to-Verifier Variant

In the direct-to-Verifier topology, the Proposer retrieves the completed A2 Action Package and submits it to the same direct Action endpoint:

```text
Proposer -> Coordination Service: CoordinationPollRequest(did)
Coordination Service -> Proposer: CoordinationPollResponse(actionUpdates: [state: readyForSubmission, actionPackage: ...])
Proposer -> Verifier: ActionRequest(completed A2 ActionPackage from poll response)
Verifier -> Proposer: ActionResponse(executed + ExecutionReceipt)
```

The Proposer may use either Action request form accepted by §6. The same client state machine also applies when the logical Verifier URL is an Action Relay.

### 14.6 Proposer Polling for Status

In either coordination topology, the Proposer may poll at a deployment-appropriate interval for non-authoritative workflow status:

```text
Proposer -> Coordination Service: CoordinationPollRequest(did)
Coordination Service -> Proposer: CoordinationPollResponse(actionUpdates: [state: awaitingApprovals, progress: ...])
```

When the state becomes `readyForSubmission`, the Proposer continues through §14.4. The Coordination Service does not infer which Verifier endpoint the Proposer will use.

### 14.7 Proposer Cancellation

```text
Proposer -> Coordination Service: POST /mpas/v1/coordination/workflow-cancel, CoordinationActionCancelRequest(actionId, proposerDid)
Coordination Service -> Proposer: CoordinationActionCancelResponse(state: cancelled, cancelledAt: ...)
```

The Proposer may cancel a pending action while it is still in
`awaitingApprovals` state. After cancellation, the action is no longer visible
to Signers and subsequent approval submissions are rejected. This affects only
the coordination workflow and does not produce Verifier `result: cancelled`.

---

## 15. Open Extension Points

Future companion profiles may define:

- application-specific Execution Payload schemas;
- clear-signing and human-readable rendering descriptors;
- richer async execution lifecycle events;
- receipt query endpoints for large or multi-receipt workflows;
- webhook subscription management;
- Credential Adapter application plugin profiles;
- policy language mappings for OPA/Rego, Cedar, OpenFGA, smart contracts, or enterprise IAM;
- additional authentication mechanisms for MPAS endpoints (§4.6 is the sole mechanism in this version);
- OMATrust identity and key authorization bindings;
- x402 payment or receipt extensions.

---

## 16. Summary

This HTTP profile defines a minimal interoperable transport contract for MPAS:

- `/mpas/v1/verifier/action` is the primary logical Verifier / Application endpoint; `/mpas/v1/action` is a temporary alias.
- The wire messages are `ActionRequest` and `ActionResponse`.
- `/mpas/v1/approval-request` is the direct Signer endpoint.
- Action Relays expose the envelope-only logical Verifier endpoint plus `/relay/poll`, `/relay/delivery`, and optional relay notification endpoints.
- Coordination Services expose workflow, poll, approval, cancellation, and optional workflow notification endpoints. `/coordination/action` is only a temporary alias for `/coordination/workflow`.
- Relay poll returns addressed Delivery Envelopes. Coordination poll returns Approval Requests and action state updates.
- Authorization Requirements bind to exactly one `actionEnvelopeHash`; `verifier.did` identifies the intended Verifier and does not assert authorship.
- Verifier-returned requirements for A1 remain bound to H1. The Proposer creates A2 with a new Action ID and authors H2-bound requirements before starting Coordination.
- `actionId` remains the workflow and replay identifier inside the Action Envelope.
- Coordination Services may index by `actionId` but must reject same-`actionId`, different-`actionEnvelopeHash` conflicts.
- The Coordination Service may assemble completed Action Packages for Proposer retrieval; the Proposer or bridge explicitly submits them to the logical Verifier.
- A relayed Verifier returns `DeliveryEnvelope<ActionResponse>` to the Action Relay, which preserves the response and any Execution Receipt unchanged.
- Relay transport and approval coordination are separable and neither is approval authority.
