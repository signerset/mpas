# bridge-generator

Development-time generator that turns an existing MCP server into an MPAS-protected drop-in replacement. It spawns the upstream server, captures its tool surface over the MCP handshake, and emits a static TypeScript bridge, an Application Plugin, and (in `generate` mode) a complete reviewable application package.

Contracts for everything emitted are specified in [`docs/features/bridge-generator/spec.md`](../docs/features/bridge-generator/spec.md); the roadmap is in [`plan.md`](../docs/features/bridge-generator/plan.md).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 22
- The upstream MCP server runnable from your shell (any command: `node`, `npx`, `docker run -i`, a binary)
- For building generated bridges: SDK `0.1.0-alpha.13` or later, either published
  to npm or built locally. The candidate release must be published before a
  generated package can install it from the registry.

## Setup

```sh
cd sdk/protocol
npm ci
npm run build
cd ../../bridge-generator
npm ci
npm run build
npm test
```

The generated-bridge integration test builds against the repository's candidate
SDK and checks P-256 signatures for direct submission, relay submission, and
relay polling. Build the SDK first, as shown above.

## Two modes

### 1. `generate` — full application package (recommended)

One discovery pass, complete `applications/<name>/` layout:

```sh
node dist/index.js generate \
  --app my-app \
  --out ../../mpas-applications/applications \
  --application-did did:web:my-app.example \
  [--prompt-secret UPSTREAM_API_TOKEN] \
  [--org-config ./my-org.json] \
  -- /path/to/upstream-mcp-server
```

Everything after `--` is the upstream command (binary, `npx …`, `docker run -i …`, etc.), executed with your current environment. If the upstream needs credentials via an environment variable, either export that variable yourself or pass `--prompt-secret <ENV_VAR>` (repeatable): the generator prompts on the TTY with echo disabled when the variable is unset, then exports it for the spawn. The env var **name** is whatever that upstream documents — the generator does not assume a particular auth scheme. The upstream only needs to survive `initialize` + `tools/list`; it is terminated after discovery.

Output:

```text
applications/my-app/
  plugin.json                     MpasApplicationPlugin — THE governed set; edit this (membership, DIDs, impacts)
  registry-entry.json             Application Registry draft (PLACEHOLDERs unless --org-config given)
  harness-config.json             Input for the compat/approval harnesses
  build-artifacts/                Advisory/debug artifacts — not governance controls
    tools-list.snapshot.json      Verbatim tool surface + toolSurface hash (regen uses it to remember your removals)
    metadata.json                 Server info, protocol version, capture timestamp
    classification.json           Heuristic impact suggestions to consult while editing plugin.json
  bridge/
    src/index.ts                  The generated bridge MCP runtime
    src/tools.json                Verbatim discovered MCP tool definitions
    package.json / tsconfig.json / README.md
  CHANGELOG.md                    Yours; never overwritten
```

`--org-config` fills publisher/application identity in the registry entry:

```json
{
  "publisher": { "name": "Example Org", "githubOrg": "example-org", "publisherDid": "did:web:example.org" },
  "application": {
    "name": "My App",
    "description": "MPAS-protected bridge for the upstream MCP server.",
    "applicationDid": "did:web:my-app.example",
    "website": "https://example.org"
  }
}
```

### 2. Low-level — just the bridge and/or plugin

```sh
node dist/index.js \
  --output-bridge ./my-app-bridge.ts \
  --output-plugin ./my-app-plugin.json \
  [--prompt-secret UPSTREAM_API_TOKEN] \
  -- /path/to/upstream-mcp-server
```

Low-level mode writes `tools.json` beside the `--output-bridge` file. Keep the two files together; the generated runtime loads its tool surface from that sibling file.

## The review workflow (do this before publishing anything)

`plugin.json` is the source of truth for governance: an operation is governed iff it appears in the plugin's `operations` (per the MPAS Application Plugin profile). Everything under `build-artifacts/` is advisory — inputs to *your* judgment, not controls the generator or harnesses enforce.

1. **`plugin.json`** — this is the file you edit.
   - **Membership:** delete any operation that should route as pass-through instead of being governed. Regeneration remembers your removals (see below) and won't re-add them.
   - **Impacts:** each operation's `impact` starts from upstream MCP metadata when available (`annotations.destructiveHint: true` → critical), then falls back to a name-based heuristic (`delete|remove|destroy|drop|purge` → critical, `merge|deploy|release|transfer|revoke` → high, everything else medium). Annotations are untrusted hints, so generated classifications remain drafts and `destructiveHint: false` never downgrades a name-based warning. Fix wrong values; your edits survive regeneration. Consult `build-artifacts/classification.json` for the rationale per tool.
   - **Identity:** replace the `did:web:PLACEHOLDER` values (pluginDid, publisherDid, applicationDid) with real DIDs, and fill `credentialRequirements`. These also survive regeneration.
2. **`registry-entry.json`** — replace PLACEHOLDERs (or use `--org-config`), set `plugin.repository` to where the plugin will actually be published, then submit as a PR to `oma3/mpas/application-registry/{application}-{org}.json`. The entry already pins `plugin.artifactDid` and `upstream.toolSurface` for you.
3. **`harness-config.json`** — if you intentionally rename tools, wrap schemas, or edit descriptions in the bridge, record it under `intentionalDeviations` so the compat harness allowlists it. Every tool you reference must exist in the snapshot.
4. Log your decisions in `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Example prompt for reviewing plugin membership

The Credential Adapter treats an operation as governed when it appears in
`plugin.json` or has an explicit entry in the deployment policy. Governed
operations receive policy evaluation; operations declared in the plugin also
receive plugin schema validation. An operation absent from both is
pass-through: with the default `passThrough: "allow"`, the adapter still
verifies proposer authorization, signatures, target binding, freshness, and
replay protection, but skips plugin schema validation and additional approval
policy before executing with the adapter's credential. A deployment can
instead set `passThrough: "deny"` to reject ungoverned operations. Removing an
operation from the plugin does not remove it from the bridge's MCP tool list.

You can give the following prompt to a coding agent from the generated
application directory:

```text
Review this generated MPAS application before publication.

Read:
- plugin.json
- build-artifacts/classification.json
- bridge/src/tools.json
- the deployment policy/config, if one is available

The plugin should contain only operations that need MPAS governance. An
operation is governed if it appears in plugin.json or has an explicit policy
entry. Operations absent from both use the Credential Adapter's passThrough
setting, which defaults to "allow". Pass-through operations remain visible in
the bridge's MCP tool list and still undergo proposer authorization, signature,
target, freshness, and replay checks, but they skip plugin schema validation
and additional approval policy. A deployment with passThrough: "deny" rejects
them instead.

Treat classification.json, impact values, names, and MCP annotations such as
destructiveHint as advisory evidence, not automatic decisions. Consider side
effects, access to sensitive data, credential use, external communication,
financial or irreversible effects, and application-specific risk. Do not
assume every "medium" operation is safe to pass through.

First, do not edit files. Propose three lists with a short rationale for each
operation:
1. Keep governed in plugin.json.
2. Remove from plugin.json as pass-through.
3. Uncertain and requiring operator judgment.

After I approve the proposal:
- Delete only approved pass-through operations from plugin.json.
- Preserve tool schemas, DIDs, credential requirements, and unrelated fields.
- Update each reviewed classification.json rationale to record the decision.
- Set classification.json draft to false only when every operation has been
  reviewed.
- Summarize the final governed, pass-through, and policy-only operations.
```

## Regeneration

Re-running `generate` over an existing folder is safe and diff-friendly:

- Generated files are overwritten; against an unchanged upstream, **only `metadata.json` changes** (its capture timestamp). Any other diff means the upstream actually drifted — read it.
- `CHANGELOG.md` is never touched. Files listed in `.generator-keep` (one relative path per line, `#` comments allowed) are never touched.
- **`plugin.json` is merged, and your membership edits stick.** The previous snapshot minus the previous plugin is remembered as intentional pass-through: a tool you deleted from the plugin is not re-added on regen. Genuinely new upstream tools (absent from the previous snapshot) *are* added as governed candidates so they can't slip in unnoticed — delete them if they shouldn't be governed. Tools the upstream dropped disappear. DIDs, `credentialRequirements`, and per-operation `impact` values are preserved from your existing plugin; operation descriptions and payload schemas refresh from discovery. (You do **not** need to list `plugin.json` in `.generator-keep` — doing so would also block new-tool surfacing; remove it if you added it under older generator versions.)
- `classification.json` is merged: your reviewed entries survive verbatim, new upstream tools are added as `name-heuristic` drafts (re-flagging `draft: true`), removed tools are dropped. It never drives plugin membership.
- `harness-config.json` is merged: the upstream command is refreshed, your `intentionalDeviations` and `env` survive.

## Building a generated bridge

Generated bridges depend on the published `@oma3/mpas` alpha release:

```sh
cd applications/my-app/bridge
npm install
npm run build        # compiles index.ts and copies tools.json into dist/
```

For local SDK development, override the published dependency without editing
the generated `package.json` by installing the checkout directly:

```sh
npm install /path/to/mpas/sdk/protocol
```

Run it like the demo proposer bridge — the config format is identical:

```sh
node dist/index.js --config ./bridge-config.json
```

```json
{
  "mode": "proposer",
  "plugin": "/path/to/applications/my-app/plugin.json",
  "adapter": { "url": "http://127.0.0.1:7544" },
  "coordination": { "url": "http://127.0.0.1:7545" },
  "agent": { "did": "<did:jwk from key generate>", "keyFile": "/path/to/keys/proposer-key.json" },
  "target": { "applicationDid": "did:web:my-app.example" },
  "workflow": { "dbPath": "./bridge-workflows.sqlite" }
}
```

For a hosted Verifier reached through an Action Relay, replace `adapter` with
the relay-facing Action endpoint and designated Verifier:

```json
{
  "actionEndpoint": {
    "url": "https://api.example.com",
    "verifierDid": "did:web:verifier.example"
  }
}
```

The generated bridge uses `ActionRelayClient` for that topology and keeps the
Coordination Service client separate. If the Verifier returns
`additionalApprovalsRequired`, the bridge explicitly creates a workflow; after
coordination returns a completed Action Package, the bridge explicitly submits
it to the Action endpoint again.

Keys come from the demo CLI (`mpas key generate`, which mints did:jwk identities); the Credential Adapter and Coordination Service come from `examples/demo`. See `examples/demo/guides/setup-macos.md` for the full local stack walkthrough.

## Behavior notes

- **Deterministic output.** Same upstream, same input → byte-identical artifacts (timestamps live only in `metadata.json`). This is load-bearing: it's how drift shows up as a meaningful git diff.
- **Verbatim capture.** Complete MCP Tool objects are copied exactly — including output schemas, annotations, icons, `_meta`, and extension fields — never summarized or renamed. Paginated `tools/list` responses are collected into one static surface. Disambiguation between applications is the job of `target.applicationDid`, never tool-name prefixes.
- **Mirror responses.** Successful upstream MCP `CallToolResult` objects returned by the adapter are relayed without reshaping, preserving structured content, resource content, `_meta`, and future fields.
- **Injection-safe codegen.** Hostile tool names/descriptions cannot break out of the generated code (tested).
- **Exit codes:** `0` success · `2` upstream spawn failure · `3` MCP handshake failure · `4` tools/list failure (including zero tools or malformed tool definitions) · `5` generate-phase validation error (bad `--app` name, bad org config, incomplete registry entry). Progress goes to stderr.

## What this tool does not do

It does not deploy anything, hold credentials, set policy, or talk to any network endpoint other than spawning the upstream command you give it. Policy (who approves what) is the operator's job via the Credential Adapter deployment config; trust in the plugin is the publisher's job via OMATrust attestation.
